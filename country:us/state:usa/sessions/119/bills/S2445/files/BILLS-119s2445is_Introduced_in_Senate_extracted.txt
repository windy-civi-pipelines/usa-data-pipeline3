 The term mental wellness means a state of well-being in which an individual experiences positive emotional functioning, pursues self-defined goals, establishes and maintains meaningful relationships, and feels a sense of meaning and purpose. At the individual level, well-being is based on fundamental family, social, cognitive, and emotional skills and supports that help individuals react, cope, and adapt in healthy ways to stress, uncertainty, adversity, trauma, and change. At the community level, well-being is influenced by the social, economic, educational, and environmental factors and conditions that either enhance or diminish well-being within the community.

                                (A)
 take a population-level approach to promote mental wellness and resilience to prevent problems before they emerge, intervene before they become more severe, and heal them when they do appear, not merely treating individuals one at a time after symptoms of pathology appear; and
                            
                            
                                (B)
 address mental health and psychosocial problems by—  (i) identifying and strengthening existing protective factors, and forming new ones, that buffer people from and enhance their capacity for psychological, emotional, and behavioral wellness and resilience for adversities;
                                
                                
                                    (ii)
 taking a holistic systems perspective that recognizes that most mental health, behavioral health, and psychosocial conditions result from numerous interrelated personal, family, social, economic, and environmental factors that require multipronged community-based interventions; and
                                
                                
                                    (iii)

 The term mental wellness means a state of well-being in which an individual experiences positive emotional functioning, pursues self-defined goals, establishes and maintains meaningful relationships, and feels a sense of meaning and purpose. At the individual level, well-being is based on fundamental family, social, cognitive, and emotional skills and supports that help individuals react, cope, and adapt in healthy ways to stress, uncertainty, adversity, trauma, and change. At the community level, well-being is influenced by the social, economic, educational, and environmental factors and conditions that either enhance or diminish well-being within the community.

                                (A)
