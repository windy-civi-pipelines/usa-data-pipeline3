IV119th CONGRESS1st SessionH. RES. 739IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESSeptember 18, 2025Mrs. Hinson (for herself and Ms. Adams) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and CommerceRESOLUTIONSupporting the designation of September 19, 2025, as National Stillbirth Prevention and Awareness Day, recognizing tens of thousands of families in the United States that have endured a stillbirth, and seizing the opportunity to keep other families from experiencing the same tragedy. 
Whereas more than 21,000 pregnancies in the United States end in stillbirth each year, and the lack of access to maternal health care services has exacerbated the crisis; Whereas racial disparities persist in birth outcomes, with Black, American Indian and Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, and Hispanic families at the greatest risk of losing a baby to stillbirth; 
Whereas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the annual number of stillbirths far exceeds the number of deaths from the top 5 leading causes of death among children under 15 years of age combined, including unintentional injuries, congenital anomalies, preterm birth, homicide, and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome; Whereas stillbirths are devastating and have a profound and lifelong impact on the families who endure them; 
Whereas losing a baby to stillbirth is linked to an increased risk of maternal morbidity and mortality; Whereas, with increased awareness and better data collection, the United States will be able to better understand why stillbirths in the United States are happening at an alarming rate and identify what can be done to combat this crisis; 
Whereas proven stillbirth prevention efforts have the power to save thousands of babies every year, and innovations in stillbirth prevention could save thousands of additional families nationwide every year from the heartache of losing a baby; Whereas recognizing National Stillbirth Prevention and Awareness Day is an opportunity to increase awareness, support evidence-based prevention efforts, promote research, encourage improved data collection and greater understanding, and provide support to those who have experienced a stillbirth; and 
Whereas National Stillbirth Prevention and Awareness Day—  (1) celebrates the passage of the Maternal and Child Health Stillbirth Prevention Act of 2024 (Public Law 118–69; 138 Stat. 1485), which opens up more Federal resources for stillbirth prevention activities and research; and
       
(2)calls on the President and all other Federal officials to use their authority to take action to help reduce stillbirths and to ensure every expectant family is educated on how to reduce the risk of losing a baby to stillbirth: Now, therefore, be it That the House of Representatives— 
(1)supports the goals and ideals of National Stillbirth Prevention and Awareness Day; (2)understands the importance of advancing evidence-based prevention efforts; and 
(3)requests that the President issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to observe National Stillbirth Prevention and Awareness Day with appropriate prevention and awareness programs and activities.
