RES. 15IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESJanuary 6, 2025Mr. Burlison (for himself, Mr. Self, Mr. Massie, Mr. Cloud, Mr. Weber of Texas, Mr. Ogles, Mr. Higgins of Louisiana, and Mr. Crane) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Rules, and in addition to the Committee on the Judiciary, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concernedRESOLUTIONRescinding the subpoenas issued by the January 6th Select Committee on September 23, 2021, October 6, 2021, and February 9, 2022, and withdrawing the recommendations finding Stephen K. Bannon, Mark Randall Meadows, Daniel Scavino, Jr., and Peter K. Navarro in contempt of Congress.Whereas, on June 30, 2021, Representative Nancy Pelosi, then Speaker of the House of Representatives, established the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol (Select Committee);Whereas the Select Committee was deficient in its composition, as H. Res. 503, the resolution establishing the Committee stated, The Speaker shall appoint 13 Members to the Select Committee, 5 of whom shall be appointed after consultation with the minority leader;;Whereas Speaker Pelosi refused to seat Republican members named by Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to the Select Committee, resulting in a solely partisan exercise determined to vilify President Trump and his advisors for the January 6th breach of the U.S. Capitol;Whereas Speaker Pelosi refused the selections of Minority Leader McCarthy and named only Representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger to the Select Committee, leaving the committee with nine members rather than the required thirteen;Whereas the Select Committee held hearings, issued subpoenas, and published a flawed report without the number of members required by H. Res. 503;Whereas shortly before hearings began, the Select Committee named Representative Cheney as Vice Chair and operated without a ranking minority member;Whereas the position of vice chair is distinct and different from a ranking minority member as clearly understood by House Rules, conference and caucus rules, and precedent;Whereas H. Res. 503 specifically required the Chair of the Select Committee to consult with the ranking minority member in certain circumstances;Whereas H. Res. 503 included the requirement that the Chair of the Select Committee could only issue a subpoena upon consultation with the ranking minority member;Whereas House Democrats failed to draft and pass H. Res. 503 in a manner giving the Select Committee Chair unilateral authority to issue subpoenas, thereby rendering all subpoenas issued by the Select Committee legally insufficient;Whereas Representative Bennie Thompson, then Chair of the Select Committee, failed to ensure the preservation of all documents from the Select Committee as is required by House Rules, including documents, transcripts of witness interviews, and video recordings of the interviews;Whereas the Select Committee promoted numerous theories without first verifying the veracity of the allegations by interviewing witnesses with actual firsthand knowledge of the allegations;Whereas the Select Committee was a partisan exercise from the beginning and its hearings and final report are tainted by the unprecedented partisan decisions made by Speaker Pelosi;Whereas for nearly two years, the January 6th Committee presented uncorroborated evidence that fit its narrative with the intent of disgracing President Trump, his advisors, and supporters in an effort to influence future elections;Whereas members of the January 6th Committee withheld and destroyed information that would have provided evidence that former President Donald Trump did not engage in an insurrection; andWhereas the imprisonment of Peter Navarro and Steve Bannon represented an unprecedented attempt to silence and marginalize political opponents: Now, therefore, be itThat —(1)it is the sense of the House of Representatives that the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol was illegitimate, and that the conclusions and findings presented were predetermined due to the committee’s partisan nature;(2)the subpoenas issued on September 23, 2021, October 6, 2021, and February 9, 2022, for Stephen K. Bannon, Mark Randall Meadows, Daniel Scavino, Jr., and Peter K. Navarro are hereby rescinded;(3)H. Res. 730, recommending that the House of Representatives find Stephen K.
