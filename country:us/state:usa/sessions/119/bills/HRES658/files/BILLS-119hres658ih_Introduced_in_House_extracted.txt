IV119th CONGRESS1st SessionH. RES. 658IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESAugust 15, 2025Ms. McCollum (for herself, Mr. Thompson of Pennsylvania, Ms. Norton, and Mr. Thanedar) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Oversight and Government ReformRESOLUTIONRecognizing the nonprofit sector and the contributions of nonprofit employees, and expressing support for August 17, 2025, to be designated as National Nonprofit Day. 
Whereas there are 1,300,000 nonprofits across the United States that feed, heal, shelter, educate, nurture, and inspire people of all ages; Whereas nonprofit organizations are the Nation’s third-largest employer, employing more than 12,000,000 people and representing 5.6 percent of the United States overall gross domestic product; 
Whereas 92 percent of nonprofits are small and community-based, serving local needs; Whereas nonprofits are trusted community touchstones and allies in designing and implementing the work of government; 
Whereas, without nonprofit partners, Federal programs would be run less efficiently and require more taxpayer dollars; and Whereas August 17, 2025, would be an appropriate date to designate as National Nonprofit Day: Now, therefore, be it 
That the House of Representatives— (1)recognizes the contributions of nonprofits and nonprofit workers; 
(2)supports the designation of National Nonprofit Day; and (3)recognizes the benefits nonprofits bring to communities across the United States.
