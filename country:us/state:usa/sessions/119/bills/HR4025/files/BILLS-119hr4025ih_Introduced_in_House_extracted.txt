Section 1:
1.Short title
 This Act may be cited as the Energy Transitions Initiative Authorization Act of 2025.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following: (1)Remote communities, island communities, and Tribal communities are commonly characterized by the unique challenges arising from isolation and the resultant difficulties in achieving economies of scale in the delivery of critical goods and services. 
(2)With respect to energy, such challenges include high energy costs, limited and non-resilient energy infrastructure, and increased vulnerability to natural disasters. (3)Self-sufficient renewable energy solutions are required to ensure energy security for these communities. 
(4)These communities require specialized assistance, which they have difficulty procuring on their own, in acquiring and building necessary infrastructure, such as energy storage, solar energy facilities, hydropower plants, distributed energy resources, microgrids, and necessary transportation. (5)Such specialized assistance should be provided in partnership with remote communities, island communities, and Tribal communities because their unique expertise and deep knowledge of local challenges and needs are necessary for the success of resulting solutions.

Section 3:
3.Energy Transitions Initiative grant 
(a)EstablishmentThe Secretary of Energy shall establish an initiative to provide grants to eligible entities to fund eligible projects for the development of resilient energy systems in remote communities, island communities, and Tribal communities. (b)Terms (1)GrantsIn carrying out the initiative, the Secretary may make a grant of not more than $5,000,000 to an eligible entity for an eligible project. 
(2)Cost-shareThe Secretary may not make a grant under this section in an amount that is more than 90 percent of the cost of an eligible project.

(D)a community organization that serves a remote community, an island community, or a Tribal community. (3)Eligible projectThe term eligible project means any of the following projects: 
(A)A project to implement energy efficiency measures in buildings. (B)A project for a resilient energy system that is a project to develop— 
(i)a hydropower, solar power, wind energy, geothermal energy, tidal power, or wave energy system; (ii)a microgrid; or 
(iii)infrastructure necessary for the transmission and distribution of electricity.  (4)Federally recognized TribeThe term federally recognized tribe has the meaning given the term in section 102(2) of the Federally Recognized Indian Tribe List Act of 1994 (25 U.S.C. 5130(2)). 
(5)Island communityThe term island community means a group of individuals living on an area of land isolated from the mainland by oceans or lakes, that is not connected to a larger regional grid network, and experiences resilience challenges, including energy disruptions or threats to infrastructure from natural disasters.
