Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Service Enlistment and Recruitment of Valuable Engagement Act or the SERVE Act.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress makes the following findings:(1)Ensuring that the United States has a sufficient number of qualified active duty military personnel is a matter of national security. To maintain force levels, the Department of Defense must balance recruiting new members with retaining trained servicemembers. However, the current recruitment environment is the most challenging it has been in 50 years. A combination of factors, including a strong economy, a shrinking eligible population, and declining trust in institutions among Generation Z, has significantly impacted the Department’s ability to recruit. As of 2022, only 12 percent of youth had a parent who served in the military, down from 40 percent in 1995.(2)The disconnect between today’s youth and the military has led to a lack of awareness regarding the benefits of military service, such as competitive pay, career training, and a meaningful mission. Research indicates that over half of youth have never considered military service, underscoring the urgent need for a renewed national call to service.(3)The Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (JROTC) program offers essential leadership training and character development for high school students. By establishing formalized authorization for students without a JROTC unit at their school to utilize JROTC units at other school within their school district, we will improve access and opportunities for students.
