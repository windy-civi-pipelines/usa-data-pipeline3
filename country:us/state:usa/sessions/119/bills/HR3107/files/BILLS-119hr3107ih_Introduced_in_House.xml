To maintain force levels, the Department of Defense must balance recruiting new members with retaining trained servicemembers. However, the current recruitment environment is the most challenging it has been in 50 years. A combination of factors, including a strong economy, a shrinking eligible population, and declining trust in institutions among Generation Z, has significantly impacted the Department’s ability to recruit. As of 2022, only 12 percent of youth had a parent who served in the military, down from 40 percent in 1995.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H135EF89F5822458880CD4F61AECDA4C1"><enum>(2)</enum><text>The disconnect between today’s youth and the military has led to a lack of awareness regarding the benefits of military service, such as competitive pay, career training, and a meaningful mission. Research indicates that over half of youth have never considered military service, underscoring the urgent need for a renewed national call to service.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H6EF438F13D5845BF9B68E74D8F72B6CB"><enum>(3)</enum><text>The Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (JROTC) program offers essential leadership training and character development for high school students.
