<whereas><text>Whereas hip hop has had notable Southern influences following its Northern inception, such as jazz and bounce from New Orleans, Louisiana, the blues from Mississippi, and country from the South, and these influences along with other celebrated genres of music, such as disco, gospel, soul, rock and roll, and Indigenous music from across the United States, have all helped hip hop transcend boundaries and contributed significant intellectual heritage and regional influence to the creation and progression of hip hop over the last century;</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas the hip hop genre has been reinvented often over the years since 1973, reflecting the State, city, and region of the music, from G-funk and hyphy on the West Coast, to bass and trap in the South, to drill in the Midwest, to reggae and dancehall influences, to many other sounds from coast to coast and from abroad, including contemporary hip hop, which continues that trend by allowing listeners not only to unwind and escape through a rhythmic beat but also to resonate and empathize with the stories being told;</text></whereas>
