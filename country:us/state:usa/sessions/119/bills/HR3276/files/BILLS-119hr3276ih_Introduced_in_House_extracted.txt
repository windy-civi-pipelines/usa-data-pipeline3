Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Local Communities & Bird Habitat Stewardship Act of 2025.

Section 2:
2.Urban Bird Treaty Program (a)FindingsCongress finds the following: 
(1)According to the 2025 State of Birds Report, bird populations continue to decline and have resulted in a 50 percent loss of tipping point bird population species in the last 50 years. The report found that policies to reverse bird declines carry benefits such as healthier working lands, cleaner water, and more resilient landscapes that can withstand fires, floods, and drought. (2)Nearly 96 million Americans—more than a third of United States adults—engage in birdwatching every year, generating $279,000,000,000 in annual economic output from these birder expenditures—including spending $108,000,000,000 annually on birding-related trips and equipment, directly supporting local businesses and 1.4 million American jobs. 
(3)Maintaining an abundance of healthy, well-distributed green spaces and bird habitats in and near communities reduces the risk of cross-transmission between wild birds and domestic poultry by dispersing bird populations, minimizing overlap at concentrated feeding or resting areas, and enabling earlier disease detection and response through coordinated monitoring. (4)Enhancing bird habitat and stewardship in populated areas serves not only to conserve bird populations and connect people to nature, but also to strengthen the ecological infrastructure necessary to mitigate the spread of wildlife-borne diseases such as Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza.  
(b)Urban Bird Treaty Program
