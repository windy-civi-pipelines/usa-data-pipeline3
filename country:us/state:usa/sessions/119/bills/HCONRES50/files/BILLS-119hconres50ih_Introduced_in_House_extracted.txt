Whereas the yellow flag with three red stripes was the official flag of the former Republic of Vietnam, which existed from 1949 until 1975; Whereas millions of Vietnamese people fled their homeland after the fall of Saigon in 1975, seeking freedom, democracy, and safety in the United States and other nations; 
Whereas the Vietnamese-American community in the United States, now numbering more than 1,500,000 people, has made significant cultural, economic, and civic contributions to American life; Whereas the yellow flag with three red stripes has become a unifying emblem of the Vietnamese-American refugee community, symbolizing freedom, democracy, and the sacrifices of those who fought against communism alongside the United States; 
Whereas, under the yellow flag with three red stripes, the Republic of Vietnam valiantly stood against relentless communist aggression while also striving to establish a just, democratic, and humane society; and Whereas this flag serves as an enduring reminder of the shared sacrifices of American and South Vietnamese servicemembers during the Vietnam war, as well as of the refugee journey and ongoing commitment of Vietnamese Americans to democratic values: Now, therefore, be it
        
 That Congress—  (1) recognizes the yellow flag with three red stripes as the symbol of the Vietnamese national community who fought alongside the United States against communism in Vietnam; and
            
            
                (2)
