Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Family Notification of Death, Injury, or Illness in Custody Act of 2025.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following:
(1)In the event an individual dies or becomes seriously ill or injured while being detained, arrested, or while in law enforcement custody, their family members deserve to be notified in a timely and compassionate manner. Such notification is necessary to uphold the basic human dignity of incarcerated people, a concept rooted in the Eighth Amendment and Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. (2)The lack of a national standard governing notification of death, illness, and injury that occur in prisons, jails, and police custody can lead to inhumane treatment of incarcerated people and their loved ones. Poor communication regarding the death of a loved one may exacerbate the grief and other physical and psychological reactions of surviving relatives.
