IV119th CONGRESS1st SessionH. RES. 496IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESJune 10, 2025Mrs. Kim (for herself, Mr. LaMalfa, Mr. Kiley of California, Mr. McClintock, Mr. Fong, Mr. Valadao, Mr. Obernolte, Mr. Calvert, and Mr. Issa) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the JudiciaryRESOLUTIONCondemning the violent June 2025 riots in Los Angeles, California. 
Whereas, on June 6, 2025, protests began in response to lawful Federal immigration enforcement actions by the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel in Los Angeles, California; Whereas these protests quickly escalated into violent riots across Los Angeles, where acts of arson and vandalism were committed, blocking streets and highways, lighting streets on fire, throwing rocks at law enforcement vehicles, and assaulting Federal and local peace officers; 
Whereas rioters have shot commercial grade fireworks and thrown Molotov cocktails at Los Angeles Police Department officers and assaulted Federal agents; Whereas rioters burned American flags, an act that disrespects the nation that protects their freedom; 
Whereas California Governor Gavin Newsom asserted that local law enforcement didn’t need any help, despite the Los Angeles Police Department declaring that the violence had worsened and spiraled out of control; Whereas more than 40 rioters have been arrested, and 5 brave officers with the Los Angeles Police Department have been injured in efforts to contain the chaos; 
Whereas local and State leadership failed to contain the rapidly escalating disorder, failing to support overwhelmed law enforcement personnel; and Whereas the actions of law enforcement have been crucial in preventing further violence and protecting law-abiding citizens from harm: Now, therefore, be it 
That the House of Representatives— (1)recognizes the right to assemble and protest peacefully; 
(2)condemns unequivocally the violence perpetrated against Federal, State, and local law enforcement;  (3) calls on local and State elected leadership to work with the Federal Government to end the violent riots and restore peace; and
       
(4)expresses gratitude to law enforcement officers, including the Los Angeles Police Department, Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, California Highway Patrol, Orange County Sheriff’s Department, other local, State, and Federal law enforcement agencies for keeping our communities safe in the face of danger.
