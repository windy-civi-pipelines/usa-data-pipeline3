dictator of the People’s Republic of China, Xi Jinping, for deceit, undermining prospects for peace and security, and orchestrating crimes against humanity.Whereas Xi Jinping is the leader of the Chinese Communist Party, a criminal organization posing a grave threat to global stability and peace;Whereas, under the control of General Secretary Xi Jinping, the Chinese Communist Party has engaged in systemic deception, warmongering, and crimes against humanity, the likes of which have few historical parallels;Whereas, under the leadership of Xi Jinping, the Chinese Communist Party routinely lied about the origins of the SARs–CoV–2 virus, using international organizations like the World Health Organization to peddle falsehoods regarding the supposed limited transmissibility of the virus;Whereas the number of individuals from the United States who have died from the coronavirus exceeds 1,000,000, representing the many lives needlessly lost as a result of the lies and deceit of the People's Republic of China;Whereas General Secretary Xi Jinping pledged to engage more fully in fentanyl cooperation with the United States in 2019 and again in 2023, only to see more than 70,000 individuals from the United States die from fentanyl overdoses in recent years, with the 2025 National Drug Threat Assessment stating that fentanyl and other synthetic drugs … are the primary drivers of fatal drug overdose deaths nationwide;Whereas, from sewage garlic to broken magnetic chess pieces, the Chinese Communist Party maintains an appalling record on consumer product safety;Whereas a 2015 study by the National Institutes of Health determined that human waste is used as an agricultural fertilizer in the People's Republic of China;Whereas Xi Jinping has doubled down on Communist China’s proud tradition of cheating in trade and purposefully ignoring World Trade Organization obligations;Whereas the People’s Republic of China was granted entry into the World Trade Organization in December 2001, and pledged to transition to a more market-oriented economy by reducing state control over trade and investment, removing price controls, protecting intellectual property, and making numerous other promises;Whereas, as of the date of the introduction of this resolution, the Chinese Communist Party continues to lie and fails to uphold many of their obligations on which their admission to the World Trade Organization was based;Whereas, under the rule of Xi Jinping, Communist China has become the largest official debt collector in the world, with 80 percent of the overseas lending portfolio of the People's Republic of China going to countries in financial distress;Whereas the Belt and Road Initiative, developed by Xi Jinping, promises only the loss of sovereignty and long-term economic and environmental devastation;Whereas the Sino Metals disaster, a story that the Government of the People's Republic of China has worked to suppress in the international press, is yet another example of predatory lending practices by the People's Republic of China;Whereas, on February 18, 2025, a tailings dam failure at a major Chinese-owned copper mine in northern Zambia released more than 50,000,000 liters of toxic waste into the Kafue River, Zambia’s lifeline, devastating the ecosystem, destroying crops, and threatening the health and livelihoods of more than 60 percent of the Zambian population living within the river basin, many of whom depend on the river for drinking water, agriculture, and fishing;Whereas the pH level, a quantitative measure of the acidity or basicity of aqueous or other liquid solutions, of the Kafue River was at least as low as 1.8 following the spill, transforming the substance of the river from water to something closer to stomach acid, which has a pH level of 1;Whereas, in June 2025, Chinese nationals were charged in a criminal complaint with conspiracy, smuggling a dangerous biological pathogen into the United States, false statements, and visa fraud;Whereas the Chinese Communist Party, under the rule of Xi Jinping, has accelerated espionage efforts, including through the 2017 cyberattack of the credit reporting agency Equifax, stealing the addresses, birth dates, Social Security numbers, and other data of 145,000,000 individuals from the United States;Whereas, from February 2021 to December 2024, more than 60 Chinese Communist Party-related espionage cases have been documented across 20 States, including the opening and operations of clandestine police stations on United States soil;Whereas the Chinese Communist Party, led by Xi Jinping, has increasingly compromised regional and international stability through its commitment to taking Taiwan by force, violating territorial integrity and Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) of Taiwan, supporting state sponsors of terrorism, and aligning itself with the Russian Federation in the unjustified assault by the Russian Federation against Ukraine;Whereas, according to data from the Ministry of National Defense of Taiwan, aircraft from the People’s Liberation Army conducted more than 3,600 flights into the ADIZ in 2024, setting a new record;Whereas, in spite of any claim to Taiwan, the Chinese Communist Party, which has not ever ruled Taiwan, continues to cause enormous harm to the well-being of neighboring countries and allies of the United States;Whereas, under the rule of Xi Jinping, Communist China has engaged in a pattern of harassment and intimidation against Philippine vessels in the West Philippine Sea, endangering Filipino maritime personnel, threatening freedom of navigation, and destabilizing regional peace and stability;Whereas the People's Republic of China accounts for an estimated 90 percent or more of the total trade of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and purchases up to 90 percent of the oil exports of the Islamic Republic of Iran;Whereas the Chinese Communist Party, under the rule of Xi Jinping, is pledging the expansion of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor to Taliban-controlled Afghanistan;Whereas, under the rule of Xi Jinping, the Chinese Communist Party is guilty of orchestrating a horrific, modern-day genocide of the Uyghur people and other Muslim populations in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, also known as East Turkistan;Whereas, under the rule of Xi

Jinping as General Secretary, Communist China has harvested the organs of political dissidents, most notably Falun Gong practitioners;Whereas the Tiananmen Square Massacre of June 3 and June 4, 1989, even 36 years later, continues to serve as a stark reminder of the sheer evil and cowardice of the Chinese Communist Party and the inability of the Chinese Communist Party to squash the aspirations of the Chinese people;Whereas, in 2020, the Chinese Communist Party significantly expanded mass forced labor in Tibet, and continues to engage in enforced disappearance, torture, cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment of Tibetans, denying them of their unique cultural identity;Whereas, in 2020, Communist China enacted a national security law, compromising the basic freedoms of Hong Kongers and unjustly imprisoning political prisoners of conscience, including Apple Daily founder Jimmy Lai;Whereas, under the rule of Xi Jinping, Communist China has continued to send defectors from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea back to that country, despite an elevated risk of execution and torture for defectors; andWhereas Christians of all backgrounds are persecuted in the People's Republic of China, especially Christians not adhering to the Catholic or Protestant state-sanctioned patriotic religious associations, which serve as propaganda arms for the Chinese Communist Party and Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era: Now, therefore, be itThat the Senate—(1)condemns the dictator of the People’s Republic of China, Xi Jinping, for engaging in a pattern of deceit, undermining prospects for peace and security, and orchestrating crimes against humanity;(2)stands in solidarity with the people of the People’s Republic of China, and
