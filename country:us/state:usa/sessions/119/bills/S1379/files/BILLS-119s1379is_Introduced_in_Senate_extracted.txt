Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Right to Equitable and Professional Auto Industry Repair Act or the REPAIR Act.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following:
(1)As technology advances and vehicle systems become more advanced, vehicle repair and maintenance will require access to extensive vehicle data, software, sophisticated replacement components, training, diagnostic tools, and enhanced diagnostic repair services. (2)Consumers and their designees must have access to vehicle-generated data and alternative parts that are necessary to maintain consumer choice and competitive pricing.
(3)Consumer choice, consumer control, motor vehicle cybersecurity, and safety are all valid concerns and do not have to be mutually exclusive. (4)Vehicles generate increasingly massive amounts of data and the Federal Trade Commission and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration are uniquely positioned, after considering consumers’ privacy and cybersecurity needs, to designate additional types of data not specifically considered or identified by Congress that consumers should be able to easily share with persons they choose for the reasons they choose and examine fair competition in evolving motor vehicle technologies.
(5)It is in the interest of the United States to foster competition in the motor vehicle repair industry and not limit consumers in their choices for maintenance, service, and repair, allowing consumers and the industry to benefit from a system that fosters communication, collaboration, and innovation and promotes consumer choice.
