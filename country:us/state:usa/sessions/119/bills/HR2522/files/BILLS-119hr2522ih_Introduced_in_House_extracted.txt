Section 1:
1.Condemning the arbitary detention of Jimmy Lai in Hong Kong 
(a)FindingsCongress finds the following: (1)Jimmy Lai Chee-ying, a Hong Kong democracy advocate, media entrepreneur, and a British citizen, has been in prison since December 2020 on multiple fabricated charges, and is serving a sentence of almost 6 years in prison under politically motivated fraud charges, concurrently serving two other sentences, one for joining a vigil to mark the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre, and another for participating in peaceful protests in 2019. 
(2)Jimmy Lai is held in solitary confinement for 23 hours and 10 minutes each day, with only 50 minutes for restricted exercise and limited human contact or access to daylight. He suffers from diabetes and has experienced significant weight loss and increasing frailty since being imprisoned. He was denied access to independent medical care. (3)The Apple Daily newspaper which Jimmy Lai founded and published was forced by the authorities in Hong Kong to close in June 2021, and the parent company Next Media was delisted from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange under government coercion in January 2023, severely restricting the free flow of news and information that undergirded Hong Kong role as a major financial center. 
(4)On August 10, 2020, Lai was charged with collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security under Article 29 of the National Security Law, charges levied in part because of meetings taken with United States officials, including those during the first Administration of President Donald J. Trump (2016–2020) and supporting publicly the policies pursued at that time by the Administration. (5)Jimmy Lai’s meetings with former United States Government officials and public figures, including the Vice President, Secretary of State, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Consul-General in Hong Kong have been cited by the prosecution in the court proceedings. 
(6)Lai trial under the National Security Law began in December 2023 and is ongoing. (7)A group of United Nations experts, being alarmed by multiple and serious violations of Lai’s rights, including the right to a fair trial and access to a lawyer of his own choosing, called for his immediate release. 
(8)The minimum sentence required under the National Security Law is 10 years imprisonment, and therefore it is possible that Lai could spend the rest of his life behind bars. (9)In 1997, the United Kingdom transferred sovereignty over Hong Kong to the People’s Republic of China (PRC) with guaranteed that fundamental rights are protected under both the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law, which enumerate specific rights and freedoms including those of speech, of the press, and of assembly. 
(10)The Government of the People’s Republic of China has repeatedly undermined Hong Kong’s autonomy since, in particular since the Umbrella Movement protests in 2014, the mass prodemocracy protests in 2019, and the imposition of the draconian National Security Law in 2020. (11)Since its enactment in June 2020, the National Security Law, unilaterally passed by the National People’s Congress Standing Committee and enforced by officials in Hong Kong as a pretext to repress legitimate and peaceful speech, assembly, and expression of political opinions. 
(12)Jimmy Lai stands for the values of democracy, human rights, respect for the rule of law, religious freedom, freedom of expression, and media freedom, and is prosecuted and persecuted by the PRC’s proxies in Hong Kong solely because of his opinions and activities in pursuit of these values. (b)Sense of congressCongress— 
(1)condemns the unjust imprisonment, mistreatment, and the show trial of United Kingdom citizen Jimmy Lai in Hong Kong; (2)calls upon the Hong Kong authorities to release Jimmy Lai immediately and unconditionally and cease prosecuting him and others charged under the National Security Law;

(7)urges the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to hold a special session and appoint an impartial and independent United Nations mechanism to evaluate, monitor, and report on a range of human rights violations in the People’s Republic of China, including the impact of the National Security Law on human rights in Hong Kong, as requested by over United Nations Special Experts in 2020; and (8)urges the Government of the United Kingdom and all governments that view extension of human rights, the rule of law, and an end to censorship as critical aspect of their national and economic security to call for all charges against Jimmy Lai to be dropped, the trial to end, and for the immediate and unconditional release of Jimmy Lai.
