IV119th CONGRESS1st SessionH. RES. 708IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESSeptember 15, 2025Mr. Carson (for himself, Mr. Fitzpatrick, Mrs. Beatty, Mr. Smucker, and Ms. DelBene) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and CommerceRESOLUTIONRecognizing the contributions of medical research and observing Medical Research Week from September 15 through September 19, 2025. 
Whereas the contributions of medical research have led to breakthrough discoveries saving lives, improving health outcomes for patients and communities, securing global competitiveness in science, boosting job creation, educating the next generation of scientists, and strengthening economic growth; Whereas medical research, through the support of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), serves a vital and unique role in the United States research enterprise, leading to cutting-edge preventative strategies and research for treatments and cures for longstanding challenges like cancer, Alzheimer’s, heart disease, sickle cell, obesity, and the mental health and opioid epidemics, to emerging threats like yet unknown infectious diseases; 
Whereas NIH funding has supported generations of medical researchers and their institutions including over 300,000 non-Federal scientists and technical personnel at more than 2,500 medical schools, research universities, and facilities; Whereas NIH-supported medical research plays a primary role in— 
(1)conducting research that is too expensive and too risky for private industry to undertake alone; and (2)supporting noncommercial foundational and clinical research funded and coupled with private sector innovation, which has led to major achievements in the understanding of rare diseases and disorders, as well as historically prevalent diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), substance use disorders, stroke, and Parkinson’s; 
Whereas NIH funding ripples far beyond its headquarters in Bethesda, Maryland, into every State, drives demand for medical supplies and research equipment, boosts local and regional economies to benefit manufacturers and suppliers across the country and into many United States territories, generating nearly $93,000,000,000 in new economic activity and supports approximately 412,000 jobs across the United States in fiscal year 2023 alone; Whereas robust investment in domestic medical research ensures self-reliance, safeguarding American lives and national interests from other global competitors;
Whereas if the United States cedes ground in developing cutting-edge therapies and next-generation cures, we risk compromising our health security and strategic autonomy; and Whereas the NIH serves not only as a medical research agency improving the health and well-being of all Americans, but also as a job creator, driver of economic growth, the premier global medical research organization, and a vital leader in curbing the Nation’s soaring health care costs: Now, therefore, be it 
That the House of Representatives— (1)supports the designation of Medical Research Week; 
(2)affirms the unique and critical impact of medical research on improving the health and well-being of patients and communities nationwide; (3)recognizes the importance of ensuring strong Federal annual funding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) that supports medical research and the discovery of cutting-edge treatments and cures, maintains global competitiveness, and strengthens economic growth; and 
(4)encourages the people of the United States to recognize the critical role of medical research in improving the health of all led by the NIH and performed in institutions located throughout the country.
