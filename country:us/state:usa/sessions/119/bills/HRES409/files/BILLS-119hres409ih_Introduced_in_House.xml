Protracted refugee situations are the result of the failure to find political solutions to their underlying political crises.</quote>;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Nakba refers not only to a historical event but to an ongoing process of Israel’s expropriation of Palestinian land and its dispossession of the Palestinian people that continues to this day, including the systematic destruction of Palestinian homes, the construction and expansion of illegal settlements, and the confinement of Palestinians to ever-shrinking areas of land;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the apartheid Government of Israel is committing a genocide against the Palestinian people which, as of April 9, 2025, has—</text><paragraph id="HAB537D71A7D542A4A35B12F1ACAA5B8C"><enum>(1)</enum><text>killed at least 50,810 people, including more than 15,600 children, with over 14,000 more still missing and presumed dead under the rubble;</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H2506F254D1BD4A74ADA2ECECEE133A6E"><enum>(2)</enum><text>wounded more than 115,688;</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H41177186B0504D2ABD24BDD902EEB549"><enum>(3)</enum><text>displaced over 1,900,000; and</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H9D2B0BB570C644589FBFA009032F12F1"><enum>(4)</enum><text>engineered a state of famine across Gaza;</text></paragraph></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the establishment and expansion of hundreds of illegal settlements and outposts in the occupied Palestinian West Bank in which approximately 737,000 Israelis reside as of 2023 is another form of ethnic cleaning used to perpetuate the Nakba;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States is complicit in Israel’s ongoing Nakba against the Palestinian people by providing Israel with weapons and diplomatic support even as its leaders openly announce and carry out plans to ethnically cleanse and depopulate Palestinian communities today; and</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas a just and lasting resolution requires respect for and the implementation of Palestine refugee rights as enshrined in United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194 and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: Now, therefore, be it</text></whereas></preamble><resolution-body style="traditional" id="H350C90B4A9734616B304B9C28A164E2E"><section display-inline="yes-display-inline" section-type="undesignated-section" id="HF9E167F7DB864EB6962DC7C2E1111458"><enum/><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that it is the policy of the United States to—</text><paragraph id="HE683CCD322A44506AB7E22165B5C6F9D"><enum>(1)</enum><text>commemorate the Nakba through official recognition and remembrance;</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H61C1BA70A9204A2D9477B620F19EDF48"><enum>(2)</enum><text>denounce the ongoing Nakba of the Palestinian people;</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H004505DF6FAF4558A498A3E4BD16E6EC"><enum>(3)</enum><text>reject efforts to enlist, engage, or otherwise associate the United States Government with denial of the Nakba;</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H60F2471283B242408831A2421462A8FC"><enum>(4)</enum><text>encourage education and public understanding of the facts of the Nakba, including the United States role in the humanitarian relief effort, and the relevance of the Nakba to modern-day refugee crises;</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H355DF765DA9C4D99A700B93421DC9986"><enum>(5)</enum><text>support the resumed provision of social services to Palestinian refugees through the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East;</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H051E8D3A62684FE8A43E4AD31DB869AA"><enum>(6)</enum><text>support the implementation of Palestinian refugees’ rights as enshrined in United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194 and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights;</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H71E342276E51491788E280B23E3984EF"><enum>(7)</enum><text>recognize that Palestinians are a unique people who are every bit as human as everyone else; </text></paragraph><paragraph id="HE66F399145344CD7BA18051B52C0351E"><enum>(8)</enum><text>reject bigoted efforts to question, dismiss, or otherwise deny the existence of Palestinians and their humanity; and</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H7CAC66863BD04A5785DE536E7E92FD7F"><enum>(9)</enum><text>ensure the United States ends its complicity in Israel’s ongoing Nakba against the Palestinian people by—</text><subparagraph id="HFF38C75587A24289BC88D11400A8F6AE"><enum>(A)</enum><text>prohibiting United States weapons from being used to destroy Palestinian homes and forcibly remove Palestinians from their land; and</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="H4C06C82E76284A7B933DDE5DA2F1D1D6"><enum>(B)</enum><text>ending United States diplomatic support for such actions.</text></subparagraph></paragraph></section></resolution-body></resolution>
