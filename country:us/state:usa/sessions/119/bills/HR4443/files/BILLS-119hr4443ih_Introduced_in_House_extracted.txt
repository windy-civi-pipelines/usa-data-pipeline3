3.Worker heat protection standards
(a)Design of standards

(2)Considerations (A)Demonstrably achievable measuresThe Secretary may presume that any requirement substantially equivalent to a requirement adopted by a State plan approved by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration pursuant to section 18(c) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 667(c)) and that has been in effect for at least 1 year is feasible.

(C)Available expertiseIf the Secretary adopts any finding or recommendation by the Institute, the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists, or the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine relevant to heat stress in a rulemaking pursuant to this Act, such finding or recommendation shall be considered the best available evidence.
(D)Employer categoriesThe Secretary may, in any rulemaking analysis or design of standards, cluster relevant employers in any categories such as standard industry or occupational classifications or any common or related features of heat sources, conditions of employment, employer practices, employee characteristics, or nature of place of employment that, in the Secretary’s reasonable determination, are useful for designing an effective and practicable program of standards, regulations, and enforcement that maximizes the health and safety of employees. (3)Protective programs (A)In generalIn addition to measures specified by this Act, the Secretary may develop a worker heat protection standard with such additional requirements that, in the Secretary’s reasonable judgment, are necessary or appropriate to achieve the purposes of this Act. Such measures may include the following:
(i)Engineering controlsRequirements to eliminate hazardous levels of heat stress through engineering controls, such as isolation or shielding of employees from sources of heat, exhaust ventilation, insulation of hot surfaces, or climate-control technologies, as well as technology-based standards that encourage the development of such controls. (ii)Administrative controlsRequirements to limit exposure to hazardous levels of heat stress by adjustment of work procedures, work schedules, or other work practices.
(iii)Personal protective equipmentRequirements to provide, at the employer’s expense, personal protective equipment such as water-cooled garments, air-cooled garments, heat-reflective clothing, and cooling vests. (iv)Health-related protocolsRequirements to conduct medical symptom monitoring, emergency response protocols, medical removal protection, or training of employees and supervisors in recognition of symptoms of heat-related illness and appropriate responses.
(v)Training requirementsRequirements to train employees and supervisors in topics reasonable or necessary to achieve the implementation of the requirements of a standard or the purposes of this Act, including— (I)training of employees in signs and symptoms of heat-related illness, emergency response procedures, and their rights under this Act; and
(II)training of supervisors in monitoring heat conditions and environmental forecasts, recognizing signs of heat-related illness, and protocols for responding to likely heat-related illness. (vi)Planning requirementsRequirements for a heat illness and injury prevention plan that—
(I)is of sufficient quality to effectuate the purposes of this Act and to effectuate the requirements of the standard that apply to the employer; (II)is developed, updated, and implemented with the meaningful participation of the employer’s employees and, where applicable, such employees’ representatives, for all aspects of the plan;
(III)is produced and maintained in writing and updated in light of changing conditions or practices; and (IV)is made available, upon request, to any employee, the employee’s representative, and the Secretary.

(B)Innovative solutionsAs the relevant scientific evidence develops, technological solutions improve, and environmental conditions or new work practices aggravate the risk of heat-related illness or injury, the Secretary may modify, supplement, or revise a worker heat protection standard by rule in order to improve such standard in light of such changes, even if it departs from long-standing past practice, provided that the resulting standard is consistent with this Act.
(C)Core practicesThe Secretary shall establish criteria under which an employer who exposes or may reasonably be anticipated to expose an employee to heat or heat stress that is not reduced below hazardous levels by engineering controls or personal protective equipment shall implement a reasonable program that includes— (i)suitably cool potable water or appropriate hydration, provided at employer expense;
(ii)periodic paid rest breaks scheduled to reduce heat stress below hazardous levels; (iii)access to shade or suitable cool-down spaces;
(iv)acclimatization policies; and (v)such measures that are necessary or appropriate to ensure effective implementation of the requirements of this subparagraph.
