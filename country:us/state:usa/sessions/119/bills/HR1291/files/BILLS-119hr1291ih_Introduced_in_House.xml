It is estimated that between 17,000,000 and 100,000,000 animals are used annually in the United States in research, education, and testing. However, the precise number of animals used in research in the United States is unknown. Such imprecise numbers make it impossible to effectively track and reduce the numbers of animals used.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H5461576C01C344EE87D80299C5270716"><enum>(3)</enum><text>According to the NIH, <quote>approximately 30 percent of promising medications have failed in human clinical trials because they are found to be toxic despite promising pre-clinical studies in animal models. About 60 percent of candidate drugs fail due to lack of efficacy.</quote>. These statistics indicate that new, human-focused biology is needed.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H362EA566BCE248C29BCA891C07BB76CC"><enum>(4)</enum><text>The laboratory use of animals has also long been a matter of public concern because, among other things, there is very little publicly available data provided by the NIH about the number and species of animals used in research.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HF80CEF2FB7C44D67ACADFD5428314491"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Effective alternatives to animals are becoming available, and their number is growing. Cutting-edge technologies have forged new frontiers in toxicology, biology, and medicine that have produced human-relevant models, including organoid cell cultures, multiphysiological systems, genomics, induced pluripotent adult stem cells, 3D modeling with human cells, molecular imaging, computer models, in silico trials, digital imaging, artificial intelligence, and other innovative methods, all of which have launched a technological revolution in biomedical research.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H60B940528BC74D049662D57917FE88C9"><enum>(6)</enum><text>The Animal Welfare Act (<external-xref legal-doc="public-law" parsable-cite="pl/89/544">Public Law 89–544</external-xref>) requires researchers to consider alternatives to animal use for painful procedures and stresses that researchers should not unnecessarily duplicate previous experiments. However, oversight is lacking, and these provisions are not implemented the way that Congress intended. As a result, researchers are not capitalizing on nonanimal models that might more effectively recapitulate human biology.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HD4FDCDA8A5F44DD5839C95AB0B594923"><enum>(7)</enum><text>A system of active incentives is needed to encourage researchers to develop and utilize humane, cost-effective, and scientifically suitable nonanimal methods based on human biology.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HA2EEFDF856604BE9BBFD9CE4206B7371"><enum>(8)</enum><text>Further, under the National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993 (<external-xref legal-doc="public-law" parsable-cite="pl/103/43">Public Law 103–43</external-xref>), the NIH is supposed to outline a plan for reducing the use of animals in research.
