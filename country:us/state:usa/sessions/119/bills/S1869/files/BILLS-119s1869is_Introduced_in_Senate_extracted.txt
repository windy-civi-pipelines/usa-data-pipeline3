                rotary-wing aircraft
            
                (a)
                Operational experimentation program
 Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Army shall establish an operational experimentation program using optionally piloted vehicle (OPV) technology, including such rotary-wing platforms as the Secretary determines suitable—
                
                    (1)
 to evaluate the military utility of optionally piloted vehicle aircraft in contested environments;
                
                
                    (2)
 to assess integration of such aircraft with crewed aircraft in multi-domain operations;
                
                
                    (3)
 to analyze cost and maintenance benefits of autonomous flight;   (4) to develop future tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) for Army aviation; and
                
                
                    (5)
 to complement and inform ongoing Army science and technology efforts relating to autonomy, such as the Autonomy for Combat Environment Sustainment (ACES), Mission Adaptive Autonomy (MAA), and the ALIAS transition agreement with the Defense Advance Research Projects Agency (DARPA).

                (c)
                Conversion
 Under the program required by subsection (a), the Secretary shall convert at least three existing rotary-wing aircraft of the Army into optionally piloted vehicles.
            
            
                (d)
                Special use airspace
 The Secretary shall ensure that all testing and evaluation under the program required by subsection (a) is conducted in special use airspace of the Department of Defense.
            
            
                (e)
                Program management

                (f)
                Partnerships
 In carrying out the program required by subsection (a), the Secretary may collaborate with stakeholders in the United States defense industry, universities, and research institutions to advance optionally piloted vehicle technologies and integrate best practices to support rapid prototyping and ensure interoperability with broader Joint All-Domain Operations initiatives.
            
            
                (g)
                Report
 Not later than one year after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and the Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives a report detailing—
                
                    (1)
 progress on the conversion required by subsection (c) and experimentation efforts under the program required by subsection (a);
                
                
                    (2)
 initial findings of the Secretary with respect to the program on operational efficiency, cost savings, and effectiveness; and
                
                
                    (3)
 recommendations for potential future procurement of optionally piloted vehicle platforms.
                
            
            
                (h)
