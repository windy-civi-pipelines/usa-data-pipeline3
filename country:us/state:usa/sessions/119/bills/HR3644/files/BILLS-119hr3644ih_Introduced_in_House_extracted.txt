2.FindingsCongress finds the following: (1)Menstrual products are a necessity each month for millions of individuals across the United States. 
(2)More than half of the United States population will likely menstruate every month for decades of their lives. (3)A lack of menstrual products, often called period poverty, can adversely affect an individual’s health and well-being. 
(4)Period poverty exacerbates the vicious cycle of poverty by further marginalizing individuals who menstruate, causing them to withdraw from daily life, forego pay, or miss educational opportunities. (5)Addressing period poverty is essential to ensuring educational equity for diverse populations. 
(6)Studies have shown that 1 in 4 teens and 1 in 3 adults in the United States report struggling to afford menstrual products. (7)Studies have shown that 1 in 5 college students in the United States are affected by period poverty. 
(8)Period poverty disproportionately affects Black, Latina, immigrant, and Indigenous households at higher rates than others. (9)Individuals living in period poverty are more likely to experience depression than individuals with access to period products. 
(10)Period poverty can increase the risk of infections due to— (A)the use of substitutes for menstrual products (such as paper towels or toilet paper); and 
(B)the inability to change menstrual products as frequently as recommended.
