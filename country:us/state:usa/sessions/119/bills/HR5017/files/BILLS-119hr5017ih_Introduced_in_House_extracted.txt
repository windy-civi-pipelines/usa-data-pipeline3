Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Greyhound Protection Act of 2025.

Section 2:
2.Congressional findings and policyThe Congress finds the following: 
(1)Greyhounds have existed for thousands of years and are the only canines mentioned by name in the Bible. (2)Commercial greyhound racing was first legalized in Florida in 1931. 
(3)Modern racetracks require internet-based wire communications to process bets and wagers, calculate odds, broadcast races, announce results, and pay winnings to gamblers. The majority of gambling on dog racing now occurs via simulcast and online. (4)Public records reveal that some greyhounds used for live commercial racing suffer serious injuries including broken backs, broken necks, head trauma, paralysis, seizures, and electrocution. 
(5)Regulatory records show that some racing greyhounds test positive for drugs including cocaine, amphetamines, barbituates, opiods, and steroids. (6)State investigatory files document that racing greyhounds are kept confined for 20 to 23 hours a day in stacked, metal cages, typically with little opportunity to socialize with other dogs. 
(7)Many small animals, including jack rabbits and hares, are bought, sold, delivered, transported, and received in interstate and foreign commerce for use as live bait in the training of racing greyhounds and in open field coursing. (8)Typically, animals used in live lure training of greyhounds may be dragged on ropes, hung from a horizontal pole which rotates around a training track, or simply set loose to be chased and mauled. Alive or dead, helpless bait animals may be used repeatedly until they are torn apart. 
(9)Live lure training is prohibited in more than a dozen States, but there is no Federal statute prohibiting such practice. In the late 1970s, the National Greyhound Association, a membership organization representing breeders, trainers, and other industry participants, announced a policy against live lure training in order to convince the late Senators Birch Bayh and Robert Dole to withdraw their proposed legislation. (10)Open field coursing preceded commercial dog racing and is an activity in which greyhounds or other sighthounds are released to pursue and kill bait animals, including jack rabbits and hares, often in a fenced area. Greyhounds may collide and suffer injuries in the chase. 
(11)Dog owners travel from multiple States and countries to compete and win prizes and sometimes gamble on open field coursing events. (12)As with commercial greyhound racing, internet sites are used to promote coursing tournaments and post results to a worldwide audience. 
(13)The National Field Coursing Association is the umbrella group for coursing clubs nationwide and maintained 12 clubs in California as of 2006. (14)Open field coursing is illegal in as many as 12 States. 
(15)Open field coursing was prohibited as a blood sport in Scotland in 2002, and in the United Kingdom in 2004. (16)25 years ago, there were 60 greyhound tracks in the United States. With the voter-mandated closure of 12 dog tracks in Florida and the voluntary shut down of Southland Park in Arkansas and Iowa Greyhound Park in 2022, only 2 tracks, both in West Virginia, will remain nationwide. 
(17)According to the State of Florida, track owners had been collectively losing more than $30,000,000 annually because of sagging attendance and decreased wagering. According to a State-commissioned report, the State spent more money regulating the industry in its national hub than it generated in tax revenue. Similarly, nearly $20,000,000 is diverted annually to subsidize the 2 West Virginia tracks. (18)According to State records, more than 10,000 greyhound injuries have been reported at West Virginia racetracks since 2008. More than 3,500 dogs suffered broken bones during this period, and at least 437 dogs died after suffering serious injuries. 
(19)Live commercial dog racing is illegal in 42 States. As of December 2022, this dying industry will remain legal and operational in no more than 1 State.
