<paragraph id="H2D5A7A679AF64220BCCE161F396D6059"><enum>(1)</enum><text>Greyhounds have existed for thousands of years and are the only canines mentioned by name in the Bible.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HC7E72E467AB447A8AA91C3CEB70D8D0D"><enum>(2)</enum><text>Commercial greyhound racing was first legalized in Florida in 1931.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H6166486F472D4A3CBCD6486E7AB270A7"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Modern racetracks require internet-based wire communications to process bets and wagers, calculate odds, broadcast races, announce results, and pay winnings to gamblers.

<paragraph id="H45E1CA51AFED4E2694CE870C6CF3CD98"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Regulatory records show that some racing greyhounds test positive for drugs including cocaine, amphetamines, barbituates, opiods, and steroids.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H7D0E96B8C68540B58644F39ED00AD997"><enum>(6)</enum><text>State investigatory files document that racing greyhounds are kept confined for 20 to 23 hours a day in stacked, metal cages, typically with little opportunity to socialize with other dogs.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H9E8202534A8F44B4881A9EA57B0B0902"><enum>(7)</enum><text>Many small animals, including jack rabbits and hares, are bought, sold, delivered, transported, and received in interstate and foreign commerce for use as live bait in the training of racing greyhounds and in open field coursing.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HD1DA54A2B99B4B6F8CC7005E3839CA10"><enum>(8)</enum><text>Typically, animals used in live lure training of greyhounds may be dragged on ropes, hung from a horizontal pole which rotates around a training track, or simply set loose to be chased and mauled. Alive or dead, helpless bait animals may be used repeatedly until they are torn apart.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H6B4FD6E519DC4773AD09D8081818AD89"><enum>(9)</enum><text>Live lure training is prohibited in more than a dozen States, but there is no Federal statute prohibiting such practice. In the late 1970s, the National Greyhound Association, a membership organization representing breeders, trainers, and other industry participants, announced a policy against live lure training in order to convince the late Senators Birch Bayh and Robert Dole to withdraw their proposed legislation.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H30B2CF077FB743EDB00C2C22ABF9145E"><enum>(10)</enum><text>Open field coursing preceded commercial dog racing and is an activity in which greyhounds or other sighthounds are released to pursue and kill bait animals, including jack rabbits and hares, often in a fenced area.

Similarly, nearly $20,000,000 is diverted annually to subsidize the 2 West Virginia tracks.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HA6D53E9D97054DA4BB6BCA12ACE72398"><enum>(18)</enum><text>According to State records, more than 10,000 greyhound injuries have been reported at West Virginia racetracks since 2008.
