Section 2:
2.Exclusion of certain populations of lake sturgeon under Endangered Species Act of 1973 (a)FindingsCongress finds the following: 
(1)The lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) holds a special place in the cultural fabric of Wisconsin, especially for the communities located on Lake Winnebago and the Winnebago System.

(3)As a result of these efforts and the development and implementation of a comprehensive management plan, the Lake Winnebago system is home to a thriving lake sturgeon population, one of the largest in North America, and the most successful sustainable sturgeon fisheries in the world. (4)An integral component of this management plan is the annual sturgeon spearing season that is meticulously managed and provides the data necessary, along with data from detailed spawning assessments, to maintain an accurate account of population levels needed and allowable maximum harvest rates to ensure the health and sustainability of the species. 
(5)Mandatory registration stations are established to collect detailed data on the length, weight, sex, and tag status of each harvested fish and ensure strict seasonal harvest caps are followed. (6)The spearing season has grown into a unique cultural event filled with strong traditions and community ties, drawing participants from throughout Wisconsin and many other States, and is crucial to the livelihoods of local communities and small businesses near the Winnebago System who rely on the annual season.
