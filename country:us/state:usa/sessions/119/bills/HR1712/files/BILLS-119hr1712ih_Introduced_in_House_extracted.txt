Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement Act or the MEME Act.

Section 2:
2.Sense of congressIt is the sense of Congress that Federal elected officials must not utilize their position, granted by the trust of the public, for private financial gain. The issuance, sponsorship, or promotion of financial instruments by public office holders will deprive the public of the office holder’s honest services, facilitate bribery by investors or purchasers, and result in public exploitation and corrupt foreign influence. Members of Congress and the Executive Branch must not seek to use their public office to benefit financially; rather their positions are held in trust for the benefit of the American public.
