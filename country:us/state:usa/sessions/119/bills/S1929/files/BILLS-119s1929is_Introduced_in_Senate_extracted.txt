Section 1:
1.
            Short title
 This Act may be cited as the Securing Enhanced Programs, Systems, and Initiatives for Sepsis Act or the SEPSIS Act.

Section 2:
2.
            Findings
 Congress finds as follows:  (1) 1,700,000 individuals in the United States are diagnosed with sepsis annually and 350,000 individuals in the United States are killed by sepsis each year.
            
            
                (2)
 There is a need for increased Federal investment in research related to sepsis to build on research supported by the National Institutes of Health, including research with a pediatric focus supported by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.
            
            
                (3)
 The infectious disease workforce, which plays a key role in reducing the burden of sepsis, needs additional support to recruit and retain health care professionals engaged in infection prevention and related patient care.
            
            
                (4)
 Sepsis is one of the most expensive conditions to treat in hospitals in the United States, with high spending compounded by frequent hospital re-admissions, including 1 in 5 patient re-admissions within 30 days of discharge and 1 in 3 patient re-admissions within 180 days of discharge.
            
            
                (5)
 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 80 percent of sepsis cases begin outside of the hospital.
            
            
                (6)
 Most sepsis fatalities are preventable with early recognition, diagnosis, and treatment.
            
            
                (7)
 The sepsis protocols for hospitals in New York State, called Rory’s Regulations for Rory Staunton who died from preventable, treatable sepsis at 12 years of age, have been proven to save lives through rapid identification and treatment of sepsis.
            
            
                (8)
 Providers and public health experts should study and learn from Rory’s Regulations to find ways to end preventable deaths from sepsis on a national scale.

            1.
            Short title
 This Act may be cited as the Securing Enhanced Programs, Systems, and Initiatives for Sepsis Act or the SEPSIS Act.

 There is a need for increased Federal investment in research related to sepsis to build on research supported by the National Institutes of Health, including research with a pediatric focus supported by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.
