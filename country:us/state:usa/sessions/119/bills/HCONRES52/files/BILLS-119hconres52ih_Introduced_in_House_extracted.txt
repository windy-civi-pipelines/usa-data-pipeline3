Whereas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are approximately 14,000,000 falls each year among adults over age 65; Whereas such falls lead to approximately 3,000,000 emergency room visits each year; 
Whereas falls among older adults cause approximately 41,000 preventable deaths annually; Whereas more than 1 out of 4 older adults in the United States falls each year; 
Whereas falls are the leading cause of injuries and injury-related deaths among adults aged 65 and older each year; Whereas, beyond loss of life and independence, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that the total direct medical cost of non-fatal older adult falls is approximately $80,000,000,000 annually, including approximately $53,300,000,000 paid by Medicare, approximately $3,500,000,000 paid by Medicaid, and approximately $23,200,000,000 paid by private and out-of-pocket payors; 
Whereas many such falls could be prevented by addressing biological, behavioral, and environmental risk factors; Whereas evidence-based, cost-effective strategies (including exercise programs to improve balance and strength, medication management, vision improvement, reduction of home hazards, and falls prevention education) reduce falls; and 
Whereas the designation of the week of September 22 through September 28, 2025, as National Falls Prevention Awareness Week would help prevent falls among older adults, including by increasing awareness of falls among older adults and awareness of methods for identifying and reducing fall risks: Now, therefore, be it That Congress—

(3)supports the work of those who collaborate to address risk factors that lead to falls among older adults, including— (A)Federal, State, and local government entities (including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Administration for Community Living, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development); 
(B)the Aging Network; (C)local community-based organizations; 
(D)the public health community; (E)health care providers; 
(F)businesses; and  (G) individuals;
                 
(4)encourages continued efforts to reduce and prevent falls; and (5)supports Federal investments in falls prevention programs.
