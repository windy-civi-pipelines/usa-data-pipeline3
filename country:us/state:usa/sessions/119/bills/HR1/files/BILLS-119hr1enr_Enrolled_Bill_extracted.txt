(iii)The State establishes needs-based criteria, subject to the approval of the Secretary, regarding who will be eligible for home or community-based services under a waiver approved under this paragraph without requiring such individuals to have a determination described in paragraph (1), and specifies the home or community-based services such individuals so eligible will receive. (iv)The State establishes needs-based criteria for determining whether an individual described in clause (iii) requires the level of care provided in a hospital, nursing facility, or an intermediate care facility for individuals with developmental disabilities under the State plan or under any waiver of such plan that are more stringent than the needs-based criteria established under clause (iii) for determining eligibility for home or community-based services.
(v)The State attests that the State’s average per capita expenditure for medical assistance under the State plan (or waiver of such plan) provided with respect to such individuals enrolled in a waiver under this paragraph will not exceed the State’s average per capita expenditure for medical assistance for individuals receiving institutional care under the State plan (or waiver of such plan) for the duration that the waiver under this paragraph is in effect.
