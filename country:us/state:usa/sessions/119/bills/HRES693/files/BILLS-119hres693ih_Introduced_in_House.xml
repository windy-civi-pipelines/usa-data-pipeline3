</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, despite PrEP’s proven effectiveness in preventing HIV transmission, fewer than 30 percent of African immigrants are aware of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and less than 5 percent have reported prior use, reflecting a critical gap in prevention outreach, education, and culturally responsive services;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas African immigrants face the highest average chronic hepatitis B rates in the country, with approximately 10 percent of these communities living with hepatitis B;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas HIV and hepatitis B and C are preventable and treatable conditions, with appropriate attention and focus, health outcomes among African immigrant communities can be improved and lives can be saved;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the CDC recommends that individuals born in Africa, or individuals born in the United States who have at least 1 parent born in Africa, who were not vaccinated at birth, should be prioritized for hepatitis B testing;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas African immigrant communities face significant challenges to HIV and viral hepatitis testing, care, and treatment;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, though they have high rates of infection, they have low rates of diagnosis and care;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas challenges include stigma, fear, lack of awareness and knowledge, language barriers, traditional values and social norms, and limited access to health care services;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas there also exists a need for providers and services to be culturally and linguistically appropriate to better meet the needs of African immigrants, in keeping with the National Standards for Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services (CLAS) in Health and Health Care, which describe a framework to deliver services that are culturally and linguistically appropriate and respectful, and that respond to patients' cultural health beliefs, preferences, and communication needs;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas immigration status is also associated with fear of health facilities, low acculturation and unfamiliarity navigating complex health care systems, social and economic marginalization, fear of deportation, and a lower rate of health insurance, all posing considerable barriers to the health of African immigrants and refugees living in the United States;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas NAIRHHA Day is a day aimed toward bringing local and national attention to the health issues of HIV/AIDS and viral hepatitis in African immigrant and refugee populations in the United States, in a way that is culturally and linguistically appropriate;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, by addressing some of the unique issues that African immigrants in the United States face through awareness, education, and resources, NAIRHHA Day will help empower communities to take charge of their own health;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the objectives of NAIRHHA Day include—</text><paragraph id="H9AAFD092F7FF43238D4567433AC65C4B"><enum>(1)</enum><text>raising awareness and eliminating stigma;</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HA2C873F8FA5B4BEBA171E4ED86022D68"><enum>(2)</enum><text>education about protection against HIV, viral hepatitis and other related diseases, placing control back within the community by encouraging screenings and treatment, as well as hepatitis B vaccination;
