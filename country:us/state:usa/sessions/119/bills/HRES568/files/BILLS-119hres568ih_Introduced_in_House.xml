<whereas><text>Whereas health care organizations, providers, and frontline health workers require sustained Federal support, clear climate adaptation guidance that addresses both physical infrastructure and psychological resilience, and reliable, consistently accessible, and locally relevant data in order to assess local climate risks, identify strengths, resources, support networks, and other key protective factors, prepare for and respond to climate change-related health threats, equitably serve at-risk populations and patients, and expand access and protections for temporarily and permanently displaced populations following a disaster;</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas frontline health care workers and providers, particularly those in underserved and resource-limited settings, face increased physical, mental, and psychosocial health risks from climate change-related events, including extreme heat, poor air quality, infectious disease outbreaks, and disaster response demands, and must be equipped with the training, protections, and support necessary to continue delivering safe and equitable care; and</text></whereas>
