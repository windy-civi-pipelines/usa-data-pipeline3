Whereas journeyman lineworkers provide a vital service on a daily basis; Whereas journeyman lineworkers put their lives on the line every day to assure safe and reliable power for the American people;
Whereas journeyman lineworkers work at heights and in close proximity to energized electric lines; Whereas journeyman lineworkers continue to provide valuable and heroic services during major national and regional disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires, tornadoes, and pandemics, along with working extremely long hours under dangerous conditions to restore power;
Whereas Henry Miller, the first elected president of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, was killed on July 10, 1896, at just 38 years old; Whereas Henry Miller died of injuries sustained while troubleshooting an electrical outage; and
Whereas there should be a day to honor those industry first responders who have given their lives in the line of duty along with those who provide skillful service in times of local or national crisis: Now, therefore, be it That the House of Representatives—
(1)supports the designation of Journeyman Lineworkers Recognition Day; (2)honors and recognizes the contributions of the countless individuals who often place themselves in harm’s way to serve their communities; and
(3)encourages the people of the United States to observe Journeyman Lineworkers Recognition Day with appropriate reflection.
