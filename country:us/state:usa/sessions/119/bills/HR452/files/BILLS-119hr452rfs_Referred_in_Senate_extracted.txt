He reminded his team when they played the Soviets, you were born to be hockey players, everyone one of you * * * and you were meant to be here.(7)The tournament occurred at a time when the United States was struggling with rampant stagflation, high gas prices, hostages held in Iran, and increased tensions with the Soviet Union whose invasion of Afghanistan led to the boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics.(8)The Miracle on Ice was a turning point for American hockey. The game was named the greatest sports moment of the 20th century by Sports Illustrated.(9)The historic win brought hockey to the front-page of newspapers everywhere, and forever opened the door to the National Hockey League for American-born players. The impact of the event was far-reaching and is still being felt today.(10)Since 1980 American interest in the sport of hockey has increased exponentially. Registrations with USA Hockey have increased by nearly 400 percent since 1980 from 136,000 to over 564,000, and the number of National Hockey League players from the United States has increased from 72 in 1980 to 245 in 2024.
