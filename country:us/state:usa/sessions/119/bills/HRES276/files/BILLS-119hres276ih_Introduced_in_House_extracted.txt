IV119th CONGRESS1st SessionH. RES. 276IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESMarch 31, 2025Mr. Hernández submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and CommerceRESOLUTIONRaising awareness of the racial disparities in the impact of colorectal cancer on the Hispanic community. 
Whereas colorectal cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death in Hispanic men and the third-leading cause of cancer death in Hispanic women; Whereas Hispanics are the least likely to get screened for colorectal cancer, with less than half (49 percent) of eligible Hispanic adults, compared with 58 percent of their non-Hispanic White counterparts, receiving such screening; 
Whereas screening for colorectal cancer can detect cancer early when treatment is most effective, and in some cases, can even prevent cancer through the removal of precancerous polyps; Whereas the United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends regular colorectal cancer screening beginning at age 45 for individuals at average risk;
Whereas, by 2030, it is expected that colorectal cancer will be the leading cause of death among people ages 20 to 49; Whereas awareness, education, and access to screening and timely treatment are essential to reducing the incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer, especially in underserved communities disproportionately impacted by the disease; and 
Whereas March is recognized nationally as Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month, providing an important opportunity to educate the public about risk factors, symptoms, and prevention measures: Now, therefore, be it That the House of Representatives— 
(1)recognizes the deadly impact colorectal cancer has to the American people; (2)expresses support for the recognition of National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month; 
(3)acknowledges the racial disparity that the Hispanic community faces when dealing with colorectal cancer; (4)encourages the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to continue and expand its work to identify those factors that result in the colorectal racial screening disparity and develop effective strategies to reduce and ultimately eliminate racial disparities in colorectal screening; 
(5)encourages individuals to learn about their risk for colorectal cancer and speak with their health care providers about appropriate screening; (6)encourages the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct research to determine any environmental factors, and the National Institutes of Health to conduct research into any factors that cause an elevated risk for colorectal cancer in young adults; and 
(7)honors the courage of patients, survivors, caregivers, and advocates affected by colorectal cancer.
