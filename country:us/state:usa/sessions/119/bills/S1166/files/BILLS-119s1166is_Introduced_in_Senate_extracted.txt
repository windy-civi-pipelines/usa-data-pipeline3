Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Excess Urban Heat Mitigation Act of 2025.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following:(1)Heat stress is a leading weather-related cause of death in the United States, with more than 600 people killed in the United States by extreme heat every year, and many more experiencing respiratory problems and heat-related illness.(2)Urban areas are likely to experience higher temperatures than surrounding areas due to design-related attributes of the built environment, including manmade factors such as low solar reflectance, low vegetation and tree cover, high building density, high impervious surface cover, and waste heat emissions.(3)Underserved communities are disproportionately impacted by extreme heat. In the United States, low-income census blocks have 15.2 percent less tree cover and an average land surface temperature that is 1.5 degrees Celsius hotter than high-income blocks.(4)Studies show that in 97 percent of the largest urbanized areas in the United States, people of color live in census tracts with higher surface urban heat intensity than non-Hispanic Whites, indicating that heat exposure is unequally distributed by race.(5)Urban heat is not only a public health threat but also an economic one, as rising heat leads to increased roadway maintenance costs, higher residential and commercial summer energy costs, and lost labor productivity, as well as the cost to patients and health care infrastructure for heat-related hospitalizations and emergency department visits.(6)Excess urban heat causes increased energy consumption, elevated emission of air pollutants and greenhouse gases, and impaired water quality.(7)Heat waves are expected to not only occur more frequently in the United States but also be of longer duration, lasting 10 to 20 days longer by the end of the century.(8)Solutions exist that communities can implement now to mitigate the challenge of urban heat. One example is the planting of urban trees to offset or reverse the urban heat island effect. Studies in multiple cities in the United States have shown that urban trees can offset projected increases in heat-related mortality in 2050 by 40 to 99 percent.

Section 3:
3.DefinitionsIn this Act:(1)Covered census tractThe term covered census tract means a census tract with a poverty rate of not less than 20 percent, as measured by the 5-year data series available from the American Community Survey of the Bureau of the Census for the period of 2019 through 2023, including such a census tract that includes an area that was designated as hazardous or definitely declining in maps drawn by the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation.(2)Covered grantThe term covered grant means a grant awarded under section 4(a).(3)Eligible entityThe term eligible entity means—(A)a State (as defined in section 102 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5302));(B)a metropolitan planning organization;(C)a unit of general local government (as defined in section 102 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5302));(D)an Indian tribe (as defined in section 102 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5302));(E)a territorial government;(F)a nonprofit organization working in coordination with an entity described in subparagraphs (A) through (E); and(G)a consortium of nonprofit organizations.(4)Eligible projectThe term eligible project—(A)means a project designed to mitigate or manage heat in an urban area by—(i)working to mitigate the causes of higher temperatures; or(ii)managing the impacts of higher temperatures or other extreme weather events; and(B)includes the implementation, construction, or maintenance of—(i)tree planting and maintenance with, wherever possible, preference for—(I)native tree species;(II)tree species with high shade production and carbon sequestration; and(III)tree species that are valuable for food production;(ii)cool pavements;(iii)cool roofs;(iv)green roofs;(v)bus and other transit stop shelters;(vi)shade structures;(vii)cooling centers with, wherever possible, preference for—(I)cooling centers that collaborate with existing community centers and spaces;(II)cooling centers with year-round accessibility, and(III)cooling centers that utilize renewable energy;(viii)community gardens, including agroforestry practices;(ix)outreach to communities about resources available under this section;(x)local heat mitigation and management education efforts;(xi)urban forestry master plans;(xii)urban tree canopy assessments;(xiii)arboriculture training;(xiv)maintenance of existing urban trees; or(xv)other actions the Secretary determines appropriate to mitigate or manage excess urban heat.(5)Environmental justiceThe term environmental justice means the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, culture, national origin, income, and educational levels with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of protective environmental laws, regulations, and policies.(6)Excess urban heat effectThe term excess urban heat effect means the phenomenon of local urban warming, resulting from manmade factors such as low solar reflectance, low tree cover, high building density, high impervious surface cover, and waste heat emissions.(7)Extreme heatThe term extreme heat means a prolonged period of excessively hot weather, with temperatures well above climatological normals for a given location and season.(8)Nonprofit organizationThe term nonprofit organization means an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and exempt from taxation under section 501(a) of such Code.(9)SecretaryThe term Secretary means the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.(10)Urban areaThe term urban area has the meaning given the term in section 101(a) of title 23, United States Code.(11)Urban forestry master planThe term urban forestry master plan means a strategic plan that establishes the overall vision, goals, objectives, and implementation tools to evaluate, maintain and expand the urban tree canopy with the intention of building resilience to extreme weather events, reducing the urban heat island effect, mitigating stormwater runoff, reducing nutrient runoff, addressing air quality, and preserving biodiversity.(12)Urban tree canopy assessmentThe term urban tree canopy assessment means a measure of a community’s tree canopy coverage as a percentage of the total land area that serves as a baseline for setting community tree canopy goals and measuring progress.
