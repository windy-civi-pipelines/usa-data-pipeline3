Kennedy Jr. vowed to investigate the scientifically supported childhood vaccine schedule, saying, <quote>nothing is going to be off limits</quote>;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, in June 2025, the Secretary took unprecedented steps to unceremoniously fire all 17 members of ACIP without cause, replacing them with 8 handpicked members, some of whom are vaccine skeptics and have conflicts of interest, including 1 who served as an expert witness against the human papillomavirus vaccine;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas just 2 weeks after the Secretary replaced all of the ACIP’s members, the newly comprised ACIP announced that it will revisit the childhood vaccine schedule, putting access to vaccines that children have received for decades, such as hepatitis B, pertussis, and polio, in danger;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Secretary’s new ACIP panel showcased an unscientific presentation from Lyn Redwood, a leader in the anti-vaccine movement and the President Emerita of Children’s Health Defense, an anti-vaccine organization the Secretary co-founded before his time in office, and following Redwood’s presentation, the new ACIP appointees voted 5–1 recommending against use of multi-dose flu vaccine containing thimerosal;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Secretary subsequently pushed out esteemed career civil servants, including Dr. Peter Marks, the Director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the Food and Drug Administration, the regulator responsible for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of vaccinations;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, in his resignation letter, Dr. Marks cast a light on the Secretary’s political interference and misinformation that was undermining the work of the Food and Drug Administration, stating, <quote>it has become clear that truth and transparency are not desired by the Secretary, but rather he wishes subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies</quote>;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, in his answers to questions for the record following his nomination hearing before the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. wrote, <quote>I will do nothing as HHS Secretary that makes it difficult or discourages people from taking vaccines but instead seek transparency in these products</quote>;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Secretary has instead used his position to continue to discredit the science behind vaccines, stoke fear about the efficacy and safety of vaccines, and dismantle vaccine approval and education programs;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the National Institutes of Health halted funding for at least 40 research grants for projects studying vaccine hesitancy and paths to overcome it;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the National Institutes of Health cancelled funding for studies seeking new vaccines and treatments for both COVID–19 and other pathogens that may cause future pandemics, requested project lists regarding mRNA vaccines, the technology at the center of COVID–19 vaccinations, and urged scientists to remove references to such technology from their grant applications;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, after the Food and Drug Administration delayed granting a license to a COVID–19 vaccine in April 2025, the Secretary falsely declared that <quote>for respiratory illnesses, the single antigen vaccines have never worked</quote>;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, in August 2025, the Department cancelled 22 mRNA vaccine development projects, as part of the Secretary’s broader anti-vaccine crusade and fixation on mRNA technology, with the Secretary falsely suggesting that mRNA vaccines are unsafe and ineffective;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, in May 2025, in a departure from the typical process and without input from ACIP, the Secretary announced that the Department removed COVID–19 vaccines from the list of shots recommended for healthy pregnant women and children, making it harder for pregnant women and children to access the COVID–19 vaccine, and months later, the Food and Drug Administration approved the latest COVID vaccines with new restrictions for use, further erecting barriers to access to the vaccine for Americans across the Nation;</text></whereas><whereas commented="no"><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Whereas, through the Secretary’s reduction in force and reorganization efforts, the Department has eliminated entirely or reduced the functionality of the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, during the Secretary’s first week on the job, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that it was stopping a flu vaccination advertising campaign during the height of flu season;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a multi-State measles outbreak impacting communities with low measles vaccination coverage has been raging during the Secretary’s tenure, with the number of reported cases in 2025 surpassing the number of cases when the disease was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000, largely due to the Measles, Mumps and Rubella vaccine (referred to in this preamble as the <quote>MMR vaccine</quote>) being 97 percent effective in preventing measles, and the most cases in more than 3 decades, and 96 percent of patients during this outbreak have been unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas instead of vocal support for the MMR vaccine, the Secretary has uplifted untested treatments like cod liver supplements, vitamin A treatments, the antibiotic clarithromycin, or the asthma steroid budensonide and directed Federal health agencies to explore potential new treatments for measles, including vitamin A treatments;</text></whereas><whereas commented="no"><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Whereas vaccine safety experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Pediatrics have found no conclusive link between autism and vaccines that contain thimerosal as a preservative, yet the Secretary has used inconsistent and often contradictory messaging around the MMR vaccine, questioning the MMR vaccine’s safety by incorrectly declaring, <quote>we don’t know the risks of many of these products because they’re not safety tested,</quote> ignoring the decades of scientific research behind the vaccine proving that the vaccine is safe, and routinely misrepresenting the potential for adverse events from the vaccine, sowing fear in the public about vaccine use;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the outbreak has resulted in hundreds of hospitalizations and 3 deaths, including 2 unvaccinated school-aged children with no known underlying medical condition. Yet the Secretary has downplayed the deaths associated with the measles outbreak, saying that more attention should be paid towards chronic diseases like diabetes and autism, while at the same time falsely claiming that there may be a relationship between the MMR vaccine and autism;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, on April 30, 2025, the Secretary made the false claim that the MMR vaccine contains <quote>aborted fetus debris</quote>, further perpetuating fears and stigma about the vaccine;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas this is only the latest in a series of mistruths regarding the MMR vaccine that the Secretary has used his bully pulpit and position of leadership as the Secretary to promote;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, in his answers to questions for the record following his nomination hearing before the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. wrote, <quote>addressing maternal mortality, and its underlying causes, will be a priority in my leadership of HHS</quote>, yet as the Secretary, he has decimated Department divisions and offices responsible for protecting the health of women and their babies;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Secretary’s illegal reorganization and unlawful mass firings at the Department have devastated the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Assisted Reproductive Technologies office (which focuses on infertility and in vitro fertilization research), Division of Reproductive Health, Women’s Health and Fertility branch, and Office of Women’s Health, and the Health Resources and Services Administration’s Maternal and Child Health Bureau;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Secretary has made a series of offensive and scientifically unfounded statements about autism, perpetuating harmful stereotypes, disregarding decades of scientific research and consensus, threatening public trust in lifesaving immunization programs, undermining the dignity of individuals with autism, and denying individuals with disabilities the services they are entitled to;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, in April 2025, the Secretary made crude, misleading, and ableist comments about individuals on the autism spectrum, offensively and incorrectly stating that they, <quote>will never pay taxes, they’ll never hold a job, they’ll never play baseball, they’ll never write a poem, they’ll never go on a date</quote>;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas reports have surfaced that the Secretary has directed the National Institutes of Health to launch an <quote>autism registry</quote> to track Americans with the disability, likely in violation of Federal privacy laws;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Secretary hired Andrew Downing, who has made a career out of vaccine injury lawsuits, including receiving financial compensation through litigation against the human papillomavirus vaccine, to begin <quote>revolutionizing the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program</quote>, and the Secretary also awarded Downing’s law firm a $250,000 contract to support this effort, upending the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program could severely curb vaccine access across the Nation;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Secretary has hired discredited vaccine skeptic David Geier as a data analyst to examine the long-debunked and harmful theory that links vaccines to autism, continuing to distort the public understanding of autism;</text></whereas><whereas commented="no"><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Whereas, during his confirmation hearing before the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate, Senator Hassan summarized the danger of Robert F. Kennedy’s words and actions best: <quote>The problem with this witness’ response on the autism cause, and the relationship to vaccines, is because he is re-litigating and churning settled science, so we cannot go forward and find out what the cause of autism is, and treat these kids, and help these families</quote>;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas leading national autism organizations released a joint statement in April 2025, on the importance of upholding scientific integrity with evidence-based research and investments in diverse supports for the autism community, rejecting Robert F. Kennedy’s rhetoric that <quote>autism is preventable</quote>, his framing of autism as a <quote>chronic disease</quote>, <quote>childhood disease</quote>, or <quote>epidemic</quote>, and his perpetuation of the myth that vaccines cause autism;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, on August 27, 2025, the White House and Secretary Kennedy fired Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Susan Monarez, just 30 days after her Senate confirmation, after the Director <quote>refused to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated health experts</quote>, and according to reporting, the Secretary was insisting that the Director approve all new recommendations from his hand-picked ACIP panel, regardless of the science behind the decisions;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, in the same week the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director was fired, 4 high-level leaders and scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention submitted their resignations because of the chaos caused by the Secretary, including Director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, Director of the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, Dr. Daniel Jernigan, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Debra Houry;</text></whereas><whereas commented="no"><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Whereas Dr. Daskalakis wrote in his scathing resignation letter that he is <quote>unable to serve in an environment that treats CDC as a tool to generate policies and materials that do not reflect scientific reality and are designed to hurt rather than to improve the public’s health</quote>;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas these are just the latest in a series of high-profile leaders, scientists, and subject matter experts to be either directly pushed out by the Secretary or forced to leave due to the toxic, chaotic, and untenable environment created by the Secretary within the Department, and his politicization of science;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, in August 2025, more than 750 Federal health employees, including hundreds of current Department staff wrote to Kennedy imploring him to <quote>stop spreading inaccurate health information</quote> and accusing him of <quote>sowing public mistrust by questioning the integrity and morality of CDC’s workforce</quote>, they suggested that Kennedy’s actions have worsened Americans’ health and safety and are, at least in part, responsible for the recent shooting at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;</text></whereas><whereas commented="no"><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Whereas, in less than a year in his role as the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F.
