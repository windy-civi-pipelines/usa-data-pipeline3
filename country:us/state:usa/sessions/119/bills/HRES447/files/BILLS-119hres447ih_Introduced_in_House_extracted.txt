Whereas antisemitism is a centuries-old form of hatred and discrimination that has led to immeasurable suffering, persecution, and loss of life, culminating most horrifically in the Holocaust, and continues to manifest in violence, vandalism, and policies targeting Jewish communities around the world; Whereas recent years have seen a rise in antisemitic incidents in the United States, including attacks on synagogues, Jewish schools, museums, cultural centers, and individuals identified or perceived as Jewish; 
Whereas the tragic and senseless murders of Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim are a stark reminder of the dangers posed by rising antisemitism and terrorism targeting the Jewish community; Whereas Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim were attending a panel discussion to promote peace and resolve conflict when their lives were tragically taken; 
Whereas Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim were both employees of the Israeli Embassy in the United States where they advocated for peace, education, and dialogue, and were both committed to standing against hatred and violence; and Whereas the murderer is a far-left activist and has been affiliated with the Party for Socialism and Liberation: Now, therefore, be it

(2)remembers the lives of Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim and celebrates their work; (3)condemns the hateful and senseless acts of terrorism that resulted in the deaths of Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim; and
