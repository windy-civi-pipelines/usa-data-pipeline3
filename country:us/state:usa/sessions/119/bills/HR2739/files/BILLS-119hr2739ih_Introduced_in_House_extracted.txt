Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Counseling Not Criminalization in Schools Act.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following:(1)Over the last 50 years, our Nation’s schools have become sites for increased criminalization and surveillance of young people, particularly Black, Native American, and Latino students, immigrant students, students with disabilities, LGBTQI+ students, students experiencing homelessness, students involved in the foster care system, and other historically marginalized students.(2)Despite significant decreases in the rate of serious crimes and violence on school campuses over the past 20 years, improving upon already low rates, 55 percent of high school students, 38 percent of middle school students, and 18 percent of elementary school students attended a school with a police officer during the 2017–2018 school year.(3)Since 1999, the Federal Government has invested more than $1,000,000,000 to subsidize the placement of police in schools, resulting in more than 50,000 law enforcement officers patrolling the halls of elementary and secondary public schools across the Nation.(4)A growing body of research has not found any evidence that police stationed on school campuses make schools safer, and the presence of police has been shown to increase the likelihood that children will be arrested.(5)Research has shown that schools with a designated law enforcement officer on duty arrested students at 5 times the rate of comparable schools without such an officer.(6)When police are present in schools, students of color face an increased risk of being assaulted by police. Student-recorded videos of police violence in schools regularly circulate through news channels, articles, and social media, exposing violence perpetrated by police within schoolhouse gates. Between 2011 and 2021, news reports detailed at least 285 police assaults of students.(7)Black, Native American, and Latino students are more likely than their White peers to attend schools with police officers on campus and are more likely to be referred to law enforcement or arrested while in school.(8)Black students represent 31 percent of all school-related arrests, despite making up only 15 percent of all public school students. Native American and Pacific Islander and Native Hawaiian students are more than twice as likely to be arrested as White students.(9)Students with disabilities are more likely than their peers without disabilities to be referred to law enforcement or arrested. Students of color with disabilities are more likely to be referred to law enforcement than either their White peers with disabilities, or their peers of color without disabilities.(10)Students with disabilities are also disproportionately restrained and secluded in schools. Of the 74,813 students who were physically or mechanically restrained during the 2017–2018 school year, 78 percent received special education services. Of the 27,499 students who were secluded during the 2017–2018 school year, 77 percent received special education services. According to a 2020 Government Accountability Office report, 70 percent of school districts report zero incidents of restraint and seclusion, but only 30 of the Nation’s 17,000 school districts are required to verify the number of incidents of restraint and seclusion, likely resulting in a significant undercount of these harmful practices.(11)According to the Department of Education, while Black girls comprise only 16 percent of girls in elementary and secondary schools, they make up 42 percent of girls receiving the most severe forms of school discipline and severe punishment, such as corporal punishment, and represent 34 percent of girls arrested on campus. In the 2017–2018 school year, Black girls were 4 times more likely than White girls to be suspended or expelled. Black girls were also 3 times more likely to be referred to law enforcement and over 3 times more likely to be arrested in school. (12)Research shows that these racial disparities in discipline rates are not a result of differences in student behavior, but instead reflect the ways in which students of color face more punitive discipline than their White peers for similar behavior.(13)Students who are LGBTQI+ often have intersecting marginalized identities and experience exclusionary discipline at disproportionate rates that make it more likely they will interact with the juvenile justice system than their non-LGBTQI+ peers. A survey of juvenile justice facilities found 40 percent of girls and 20 percent of all detained youth identified as LGBTQI+, and the overwhelming majority (85 percent) of LGBTQI+ detained youth were youth of color.(14)Students who are suspended or expelled are nearly 3 times more likely to be in contact with the juvenile justice system the following year.(15)According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, more than 30,000 children under the age of 10 were arrested since 2013. On school campuses, more than 290,000 students were referred to law enforcement. The United States spends $240 daily, on average, per youth detained in juvenile facilities.(16)While schools should be sanctuaries for all students, reports have shown instances where police in schools collect tips and disciplinary information from teachers and school administrators and share it with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to build deportation cases against students and their families.(17)School hardening, including the presence of law enforcement officers on campus, causes students to experience higher levels of fear, perpetuates the school to prison pipeline, and undermines the ability of schools and educators to build learning environments based on mutual trust, respect, and safety.(18)Ninety percent of students are in public schools where the number of counselors, social workers, nurses, and psychologists do not meet recommended professional standards. Professional standards recommend at least 1 counselor and 1 social worker for every 250 students and at least 1 nurse and 1 psychologist for every 750 students and every 700 students, respectively. (19)1,700,000 students attend schools with police but not 1 counselor.(20)3,000,000 students attend schools with police but not 1 school nurse.(21)6,000,000 students attend schools with police but not 1 school psychologist.(22)10,000,000 students attend schools with police but not 1 social worker.

Section 3:
3.PurposeIt is the purpose of this Act to—(1)address the needs of marginalized students, ensure schools are welcoming for students, and improve academic outcomes by eliminating Federal funding for maintaining the presence of covered law enforcement officers in schools and establishing a continuum of care and positive schoolwide systems of services that are evidence-based, inclusive, racially and gender responsive, and trauma informed; and (2)support local educational agencies that choose to terminate their contracts with local law enforcement agencies or, where applicable, dissolve or disband district-based police departments, and invest resources in personnel and services that create safe and inclusive schools for all students based on community engagement and deliberative consultation.
