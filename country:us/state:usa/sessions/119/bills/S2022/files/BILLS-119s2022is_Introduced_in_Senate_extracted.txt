Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following: (1)There is a unique Federal legal and political relationship between the United States and Indian Tribes. 
(2)Indian Tribes have the responsibility and authority to provide governmental programs and services to Tribal citizens, develop Tribal economies, and build community infrastructure to ensure that Indian reservation lands serve as livable, permanent homes. (3)The United States Constitution, United States Federal Court decisions, Executive orders, and numerous other Federal laws and regulations recognize that Indian Tribes are governments, retaining the inherent authority to tax and operate as other governments, including (inter alia) financing projects with government bonds and maintaining eligibility for general tax exemptions via their government status. 
(4)Codifying tax parity with respect to Tribal Governments is consistent with Federal treaties recognizing the sovereignty of Tribal Governments. (5)That Indian Tribes face historic disadvantages in accessing the underlying capital to build the necessary infrastructure for job creation, and that certain statutory restrictions on Tribal governance further inhibit Tribes’ ability to develop strong governance and economies. 
(6)Indian Tribes are sometimes excluded from the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 in key provisions which results in unfair tax treatment for Tribal citizens or unequal enforcement authority for Tribal enforcement agencies. (7)Congress is vested with the authority to regulate commerce with Indian Tribes, and hereby exercises that authority in a manner which furthers Tribal self-governance, and in doing so, further affirms the United States government-to-government relationship with Indian Tribes.

119th CONGRESS1st Session 
S. 2022 
IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES 
 
June 11, 2025 
Ms. Cortez Masto (for herself and Ms. Murkowski) introduced the following bill; which was read twice and referred to the Committee on Finance 
 
A BILL 
To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to treat Indian Tribal Governments in the same manner as State governments for certain Federal tax purposes, and for other purposes. 
 
 
1.Short title; table of contents 
(a)Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Tribal Tax and Investment Reform Act of 2025. (b)Table of contentsThe table of contents of this Act is as follows: 
 
Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents. 
Sec. 2. Findings. 
Sec. 3. Treatment of Indian tribes as States with respect to excise taxes and bond issuance. 
Sec. 4. Treatment of pension and employee benefit plans maintained by Tribal Governments. 
Sec. 5. Treatment of Tribal foundations and charities like charities funded and controlled by other governmental funders and sponsors. 
Sec. 6. Improving effectiveness of Tribal child support enforcement agencies. 
Sec. 7. Recognizing Indian tribal governments for purposes of determining under the adoption credit whether a child has special needs.

Sec. 11. Indian employment tax credit. 
Sec. 12. Exclusion from gross income for payments under Indian health service loan repayment program. 
Sec. 13. Exclusion of certain amounts received under Indian Health Professions Scholarships Program. 
2.FindingsCongress finds the following: (1)There is a unique Federal legal and political relationship between the United States and Indian Tribes. 
(2)Indian Tribes have the responsibility and authority to provide governmental programs and services to Tribal citizens, develop Tribal economies, and build community infrastructure to ensure that Indian reservation lands serve as livable, permanent homes. (3)The United States Constitution, United States Federal Court decisions, Executive orders, and numerous other Federal laws and regulations recognize that Indian Tribes are governments, retaining the inherent authority to tax and operate as other governments, including (inter alia) financing projects with government bonds and maintaining eligibility for general tax exemptions via their government status. 
(4)Codifying tax parity with respect to Tribal Governments is consistent with Federal treaties recognizing the sovereignty of Tribal Governments. (5)That Indian Tribes face historic disadvantages in accessing the underlying capital to build the necessary infrastructure for job creation, and that certain statutory restrictions on Tribal governance further inhibit Tribes’ ability to develop strong governance and economies. 
(6)Indian Tribes are sometimes excluded from the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 in key provisions which results in unfair tax treatment for Tribal citizens or unequal enforcement authority for Tribal enforcement agencies. (7)Congress is vested with the authority to regulate commerce with Indian Tribes, and hereby exercises that authority in a manner which furthers Tribal self-governance, and in doing so, further affirms the United States government-to-government relationship with Indian Tribes. 
3.Treatment of Indian tribes as States with respect to excise taxes and bond issuance
