Section 2:
2.PurposeThe purpose of this Act is to require billionaires to pay taxes annually by eliminating the ability of high income and high net worth taxpayers to use tax planning strategies such as buy, borrow, die to defer paying taxes indefinitely, specifically by—(1)under the provisions of title I of this Act—(A)requiring high income and high net worth taxpayers to pay tax on the income they earn on an annual basis, just like working people do on their income from wages, through mark-to-market taxation, and(B)shutting down the ability of the ultra wealthy to buy and hold appreciating assets and borrow against those assets to support their lavish lifestyles, all completely tax-free, and(2)under the provisions of title II of this Act, closing loopholes in the tax code that allow high income and high net worth taxpayers to shield their income from taxation, including the loophole that allows ultra wealthy taxpayers to transfer untaxed appreciated assets to their heirs at death and such heirs to sell such assets completely tax-free.
