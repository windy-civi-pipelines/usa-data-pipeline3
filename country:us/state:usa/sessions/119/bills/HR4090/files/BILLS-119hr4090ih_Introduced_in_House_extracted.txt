Section 1:
1.PolicyIt is the policy of the United States to establish the position of the United States as the leading producer of hardrock minerals, including rare earth minerals, which will— (1)create jobs and prosperity at home; 
(2)strengthen supply chains for the United States and the allies of the United States; (3)safeguard the national Security of the United States; and 
(4)reduce the global influence of malign and adversarial states.

Section 4:
4.Mining potential on Federal land (a)In generalThe Secretary shall identify all Federal land managed by the Secretary or the Secretary of Agriculture, which may be leased for the exploration, development, or production of hardrock minerals or is open to location under the Act of May 10, 1872 (commonly known as the Mining Law of 1872), where— 
(1)hardrock mineral exploration is being conducted; (2)the Secretary, in consultation with the United States Geological Survey, determines hardrock minerals may be present but where thorough exploration has not been conducted; or

Section 6:
6.Map baby map 
(a)In generalThe Secretary shall prioritize efforts to accelerate the ongoing, detailed geologic mapping of the United States, with a focus on mapping previously unknown deposits of hardrock minerals. (b)ReportNot later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate a report regarding the progress and estimated completion date of the comprehensive national modern surface and subsurface mapping and data integration effort of the Department of the Interior described in section 40201 of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (43 U.S.C. 311).

Section 7:
7.DefinitionsIn this Act: (1)Federal landThe term Federal land means—
