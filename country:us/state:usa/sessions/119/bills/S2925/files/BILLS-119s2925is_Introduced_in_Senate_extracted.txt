Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Management of Individuals’ Neural Data Act of 2025 or the MIND Act of 2025.

Section 2:
2.Sense of CongressIt is the sense of Congress that—(1)an individual’s neural data and other related data can be monetized and used to shape individual behavior, emotional states, and decision making in ways existing laws do not adequately address;(2)vertical corporate integration of neurotechnology, artificial intelligence systems, wearable devices, digital platforms, and global data infrastructure may create interconnected systems with insufficient transparency, accountability, or user control regarding the use of such data;(3)such concentration increases the risk of behavioral influence, cognitive manipulation, erosion of personal autonomy, and the exacerbation of existing social and economic disparities, particularly in the absence of enforceable privacy protections, including protections of neural data and other related data;(4)the absence of a comprehensive Federal standard for the collection, processing, and international transfer of such data presents risks to civil liberties and to national security, given the dual-use potential of and foreign interest in the data assets of the United States;(5)strong protections for such data are essential to safeguard privacy, prevent discrimination and exploitation, and ensure that innovation in neurotechnology applications proceeds with accountability and public trust; and(6)while this Act focuses primarily on neural data, related biometric and behavioral data that can reveal mental states may pose similar risks and warrant comparative analysis to identify broader privacy gaps.

Section 3:
3.DefinitionsIn this Act:(1)Artificial intelligenceThe term artificial intelligence has the meaning given such term in section 5002 of the National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Act of 2020 (15 U.S.C. 9401).(2)CommissionThe term Commission means the Federal Trade Commission.(3)Federal agencyThe term Federal agency has the meaning given the term agency in section 551 of title 5, United States Code.(4)Neural dataThe term neural data means information obtained by measuring the activity of an individual’s central or peripheral nervous system through the use of neurotechnology.(5)NeurotechnologyThe term neurotechnology means a device, system, or procedure that accesses, monitors, records, analyzes, predicts, stimulates or alters the nervous system of an individual to understand, influence, restore, or anticipate the structure, activity, or function of the nervous system.(6)Other related dataThe term other related data—(A)means biometric, physiological, or behavioral information that does not directly measure the neural activity or central or peripheral nervous system of an individual, but can be processed, analyzed, or combined with other data to infer, predict, or reveal cognitive, emotional, or psychological states or neurological conditions; and(B)may include heart rate variability, eye-tracking patterns, voice analysis, facial expression recognition, sleep patterns, or other signals derived from consumer devices, wearables, or biosensors.
