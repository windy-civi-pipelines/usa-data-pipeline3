Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Trump Derangement Syndrome Research Act of 2025 or the TDS Research Act of 2025.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following:
(1)Trump Derangement Syndrome has been described as a behavioral or psychological phenomenon involving intense emotional or cognitive reactions to Donald J. Trump, his actions, or his public presence, with early documented references emerging during his 2016 presidential campaign. (2)Notable early instances of TDS include certain media coverage amplifying polarized responses to Donald J. Trump’s campaign rhetoric, which some observers cite as initial signs of TDS, though precise origins remain understudied.
(3)Recurrent, selective reporting by media outlets, emphasizing aspects of Donald J. Trump’s actions or statements while omitting broader context, has been alleged to contribute to TDS by intensifying polarized public reactions and deepening societal division. (4)Frequent amplification of unverified or anonymously sourced claims about Donald J. Trump’s conduct has further fueled TDS, driving significant public outrage and contributing to heightened emotional responses among individuals and groups.
(5)The following two confirmed assassination attempts against Donald J. Trump occurred in 2024: (A)On July 13, 2024, at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, a shooter wounded Donald J. Trump’s ear, killed one attendee, and injured two others.
(B)On September 15, 2024, at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida, a suspect was apprehended with a rifle and the incident was investigated as an assassination attempt. (6)Understanding TDS may contribute to broader insights into political polarization, media influence, and psychological responses to public figures, with implications for public health and social cohesion.
(7)The National Institutes of Health, through its existing programs, is well-positioned to study the psychological and social factors underlying TDS, including its origins, media influences, and potential links to extreme behaviors, to inform public health strategies.
