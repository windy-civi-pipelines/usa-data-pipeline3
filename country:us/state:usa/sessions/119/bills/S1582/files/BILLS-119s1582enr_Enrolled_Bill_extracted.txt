          In general
 A payment stablecoin that is issued by a foreign payment stablecoin issuer may not be publicly offered, sold, or otherwise made available for trading in the United States by a digital asset service provider unless the foreign payment stablecoin issuer has the technological capability to comply and complies with the terms of any lawful order.   (2) Enforcement  (A) Authority The Secretary of the Treasury shall have the authority to designate any foreign issuer that publicly offers, sells, or otherwise makes available a payment stablecoin in violation of paragraph (1) as noncompliant.

(3) Appeal A determination of noncompliance under this subsection is subject to judicial review in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

        Publication of designation; prohibition on secondary trading
        
          (1)
          In general
 If a foreign payment stablecoin issuer does not come into compliance with the lawful order within 30 days from the date of issuance of the written notice described in subsection (a), except as provided in subsection (c), the Secretary of the Treasury shall—  (A) publish the determination of noncompliance in the Federal Register, including a statement on the failure of the foreign payment stablecoin issuer to comply with the lawful order after the written notice; and
          
          
            (B)

          Expiration of prohibition
          
            (A)
            In general

(B) Rulemaking Consistent with section 13, the Secretary of the Treasury shall specify the criteria that a noncompliant foreign issuer must meet for the Secretary of the Treasury to determine that the foreign payment stablecoin issuer is no longer noncompliant.
          
          
            (C)
            Publication

            (A)
            Digital asset service providers
 Any digital asset service provider that knowingly violates a prohibition under paragraph (1)(B) shall be subject to a civil monetary penalty of not more than $100,000 per violation per day.   (B) Foreign payment stablecoin issuers Any foreign payment stablecoin issuer that knowingly continues to publicly offer a payment stablecoin in the United States after publication of the determination of noncompliance under paragraph (1)(A) shall be subject to a civil monetary penalty of not more than $1,000,000 per violation per day, and the Secretary of the Treasury may seek an injunction in a district court of the United States to bar the foreign payment stablecoin issuer from engaging in financial transactions in the United States or with United States persons. 
          
          
            (C)
            Determination of the number of violations
 For purposes of determining the number of violations for which to impose a penalty under subparagraph (A) or (B), separate acts of noncompliance are a single violation when the acts are the result of a common or substantially overlapping originating cause. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Secretary of Treasury may determine that multiple acts of noncompliance constitute separate violations if such acts were the result of gross negligence, a reckless disregard for, or a pattern of indifference to, money laundering, financing of terrorism, or sanctions evasion requirements.   (D) Commencement of civil actions The Secretary of the Treasury may commence a civil action against a foreign payment stablecoin issuer in a district court of the United States to—

(c) Waiver and licensing authority exemptions  (1) In general The Secretary of the Treasury may offer a waiver, general license, or specific license to any United States person engaging in secondary trading described in subsection (b)(1)(B) on a case-by-case basis if the Secretary determines that—
          
            (A)
 prohibiting secondary trading would adversely affect the financial system of the United States; or   (B) the foreign payment stablecoin issuer is taking tangible steps to remedy the failure to comply with the lawful order that resulted in the noncompliance determination under subsection (a).
          
        
        
          (2)
          National security waiver

(B) Foreign payment stablecoin issuers Any foreign payment stablecoin issuer that knowingly continues to publicly offer a payment stablecoin in the United States after publication of the determination of noncompliance under paragraph (1)(A) shall be subject to a civil monetary penalty of not more than $1,000,000 per violation per day, and the Secretary of the Treasury may seek an injunction in a district court of the United States to bar the foreign payment stablecoin issuer from engaging in financial transactions in the United States or with United States persons. 
          
          
            (C)
            Determination of the number of violations
 For purposes of determining the number of violations for which to impose a penalty under subparagraph (A) or (B), separate acts of noncompliance are a single violation when the acts are the result of a common or substantially overlapping originating cause. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Secretary of Treasury may determine that multiple acts of noncompliance constitute separate violations if such acts were the result of gross negligence, a reckless disregard for, or a pattern of indifference to, money laundering, financing of terrorism, or sanctions evasion requirements.   (D) Commencement of civil actions The Secretary of the Treasury may commence a civil action against a foreign payment stablecoin issuer in a district court of the United States to—

(c) Waiver and licensing authority exemptions  (1) In general The Secretary of the Treasury may offer a waiver, general license, or specific license to any United States person engaging in secondary trading described in subsection (b)(1)(B) on a case-by-case basis if the Secretary determines that—
          
            (A)
 prohibiting secondary trading would adversely affect the financial system of the United States; or   (B) the foreign payment stablecoin issuer is taking tangible steps to remedy the failure to comply with the lawful order that resulted in the noncompliance determination under subsection (a).
          
        
        
          (2)
