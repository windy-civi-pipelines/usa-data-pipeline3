Section 3:
3. Findings; sense of Congress  (a) Findings Congress makes the following findings:
                
                    (1)
 Between June 28, 2022, and January 15, 2025, with strong bipartisan support, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the Department of the Treasury and the Department of State designated, for the imposition of sanctions, a wide range of entities and individuals based in the People’s Republic of China that have been involved in supplying goods to Russian entities responsible for developing, producing, and supplying items critical to the defense industrial base of the Russian Federation. Those designations targeted, among other entities, producers and exporters of computer numerical control items, electro-optical equipment, radar components, satellite imagery, aviation components, chemical ingredients in Russian explosives, and other defense and dual-use equipment and technology critical to the Russian Federation's defense industrial base.
                
                
                    (2)
 Entities and individuals based in the People’s Republic of China continue to evade United States sanctions to provide material support to the defense industrial base of the Russian Federation.
                
                
                    (3)
 Under Executive Order 13959 (50 U.S.C. 1701 note; related to addressing the threat from securities investments that finance Communist Chinese military companies), the President found that the People’s Republic of China increases the size of the country’s military-industrial complex by compelling civilian Chinese companies to support its military and intelligence activities. Those companies, though remaining ostensibly private and civilian, directly support the PRC’s military, intelligence, and security apparatuses and aid in their development and modernization..
                
                
                    (4)
 Ongoing support for the defense industrial base of the Russian Federation by the People’s Republic of China requires concerted action by the Department of the Treasury and the Department of State to protect the national security of the United States.
                
            
            
                (b)
                Sense of Congress
 It is the sense of Congress that—  (1) the Russian Federation’s continued invasion of Ukraine is directly enabled by the ongoing support of the People’s Republic of China for the defense industrial base of the Russian Federation; and
                
                
                    (2)
 in response, and to impede the support of the People’s Republic of China for the Russian Federation’s war against Ukraine, the President should—
                    
                        (A)
 cut off financing avenues for entities in the People’s Republic of China that are providing material support to the defense and related sectors of the economy of the Russian Federation;
                    
                    
                        (B)
 impose sanctions with respect to entities and individuals in the People’s Republic of China involved in the export of weapons and dual-use technology to the Russian Federation;
                    
                    
                        (C)
 determine whether the United States should impose sanctions with respect to major arms exporters in the People's Republic of China for aiding the defense industrial base of the Russian Federation; and
                    
                    
                        (D)
 develop a strategy to coordinate with allies and partners of the United States to deter and undermine the ongoing support of the People's Republic of China for the Russian Federation’s war in Ukraine.

                        (B)
                        Current visas revoked

                    (1)
 Between June 28, 2022, and January 15, 2025, with strong bipartisan support, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the Department of the Treasury and the Department of State designated, for the imposition of sanctions, a wide range of entities and individuals based in the People’s Republic of China that have been involved in supplying goods to Russian entities responsible for developing, producing, and supplying items critical to the defense industrial base of the Russian Federation. Those designations targeted, among other entities, producers and exporters of computer numerical control items, electro-optical equipment, radar components, satellite imagery, aviation components, chemical ingredients in Russian explosives, and other defense and dual-use equipment and technology critical to the Russian Federation's defense industrial base.
                
                
                    (2)
 Entities and individuals based in the People’s Republic of China continue to evade United States sanctions to provide material support to the defense industrial base of the Russian Federation.
                
                
                    (3)
 Under Executive Order 13959 (50 U.S.C. 1701 note; related to addressing the threat from securities investments that finance Communist Chinese military companies), the President found that the People’s Republic of China increases the size of the country’s military-industrial complex by compelling civilian Chinese companies to support its military and intelligence activities. Those companies, though remaining ostensibly private and civilian, directly support the PRC’s military, intelligence, and security apparatuses and aid in their development and modernization..
                
                
                    (4)
 Ongoing support for the defense industrial base of the Russian Federation by the People’s Republic of China requires concerted action by the Department of the Treasury and the Department of State to protect the national security of the United States.
                
            
            
                (b)
                Sense of Congress
 It is the sense of Congress that—  (1) the Russian Federation’s continued invasion of Ukraine is directly enabled by the ongoing support of the People’s Republic of China for the defense industrial base of the Russian Federation; and
                
                
                    (2)
 in response, and to impede the support of the People’s Republic of China for the Russian Federation’s war against Ukraine, the President should—
                    
                        (A)
 cut off financing avenues for entities in the People’s Republic of China that are providing material support to the defense and related sectors of the economy of the Russian Federation;
                    
                    
                        (B)
 impose sanctions with respect to entities and individuals in the People’s Republic of China involved in the export of weapons and dual-use technology to the Russian Federation;
                    
                    
                        (C)
 determine whether the United States should impose sanctions with respect to major arms exporters in the People's Republic of China for aiding the defense industrial base of the Russian Federation; and
                    
                    
                        (D)
 develop a strategy to coordinate with allies and partners of the United States to deter and undermine the ongoing support of the People's Republic of China for the Russian Federation’s war in Ukraine.

                        (F)
