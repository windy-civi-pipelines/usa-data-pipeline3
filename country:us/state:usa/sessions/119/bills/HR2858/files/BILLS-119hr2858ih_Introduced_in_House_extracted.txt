1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Winter Canola Study Act of 2025.

Section 2:
2.Purposes and findings(a)PurposesThe purposes of this Act are the following:(1)To ensure the continued growth of clean and sustainable feedstocks, supported by new crop insurance products that recognize double-cropping systems.(2)To recognize the importance and regionality characteristics of winter canola grown rotationally or as a double-crop and the economic and environmental benefits to producers.(3)To recognize that by investing in lower carbon-intensity renewable fuels, such as those produced from winter canola crops, the United States can provide sustainable fuels, create jobs, enhance our rural communities, and bolster our national security.(b)FindingsCongress finds the following:(1)Winter Canola improves farm economics.(2)Oil from winter canola is a source of renewable energy as a feedstock for biodiesel, renewable diesel, and jet biofuel.(3)Winter canola oil-based renewable fuels reduce greenhouse gas emissions by over 50 percent compared to conventional fuels.(4)Expanding winter canola production will provide additional feedstock to meet growing renewable fuel demand without bringing new land into production.
