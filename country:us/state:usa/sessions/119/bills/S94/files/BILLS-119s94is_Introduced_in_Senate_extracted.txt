The game was named the greatest sports moment of the 20th century by Sports Illustrated.(9)The historic win brought ice hockey to the front-page of newspapers everywhere, and forever opened the door to the National Hockey League for players born in the United States. The impact of the event was far-reaching and is still being felt today.(10)Since 1980, interest in the United States in the sport of ice hockey has increased exponentially.
