                (c)
                Technical Capabilities
 The capability demonstration delivered under subsection (b)(2) shall demonstrate a satellite system that has—
                
                    (1)
 the ability to operate in the absence of Global Positioning System services;
                
                
                    (2)

                    (3)
 greater resistance to jamming and spoofing threats compared to existing Global Positioning System services, to an extent determined by the Secretary;
                
                
                    (4)

                    (5)
 the ability to restore service if some or all satellites in the satellite system are disabled, in a cadence as determined by the Secretary that substantially decreases the time to service restoration compared to what is possible under existing Global Positioning System service.
                
            
            
                (d)
