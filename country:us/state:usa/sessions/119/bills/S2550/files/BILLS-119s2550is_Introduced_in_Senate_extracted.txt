            Definition of critical mineral
 In this Act, the term critical mineral—
            
                (1)
 has the meaning given the term in section 7002 of the Energy Act of 2020 (30 U.S.C. 1606); and
            
            
                (2)
 includes any other mineral or mineral material determined by the Secretary of State—
                
                    (A)
 to be essential to the economic or national security of the United States; and

 to have a supply chain vulnerable to disruption.

Section 3:
3.
            Statement of policy on critical mineral
                supply chains
 It is the policy of the United States—  (1) to collaborate with allies and partners of the United States to build secure and resilient critical minerals supply chains, including in the mining, processing, reclamation and recycling, and valuation of critical minerals;
            
            
                (2)
 to prioritize the development and production of critical mineral resources domestically, including through improvement of systems for collecting and recycling critical minerals from used and discarded goods or equipment, both to supply domestic needs and for export to allies and partners that participate in secure and resilient supply chains for critical minerals;
            
            
                (3)
 to reduce or eliminate reliance and dependence on critical mineral supply chains controlled by the People’s Republic of China, the Russian Federation, Iran, or any other adversary of the United States;
            
            
                (4)
 to work with allies and partners on enhancing evaluation capability and technology in trusted countries that produce critical minerals to avoid the export of critical minerals, or products or components that are dependent on critical minerals, that are controlled by adversaries of the United States;
            
            
                (5)
 to identify and implement market-based incentives for the purposes of facilitating the creation and maintenance of secure and resilient critical mineral supply chains, including for reclamation and recycling of critical mineral resources from waste streams, in collaboration with allies and partners;
            
            
                (6)
 to prioritize securing critical mineral supply chains in United States foreign policy, including through the use of economic tools to invest responsibly in projects in partner countries in a manner that both benefits local populations and bolsters the supply of critical minerals to the United States and allies and partners of the United States; and
            
            
                (7)
 that collaboration with allies and partners to build secure and resilient critical mineral supply chains shall not replace United States efforts to increase domestic development and production or recycling of critical minerals.
