Section 1:
1.
            Short title
 This Act may be cited as the DeOndra Dixon INCLUDE Project Act of 2025.

Section 2:
2.
            Findings
 Congress finds the following:  (1) Down syndrome is the most common chromosomal disorder. Each year, about 6,000 babies born in the United States have Down syndrome, affecting about 1 in every 700 babies born.
            
            
                (2)
 Individuals with Down syndrome have a full or partial extra copy of chromosome 21 that leads to certain physical, intellectual, and developmental challenges.
            
            
                (3)
 Life expectancy of individuals with Down syndrome in the United States has increased dramatically in recent decades. In 1960, the average life expectancy was about 10 years. Today, the average life expectancy of an individual with Down syndrome is nearly 60 years.
            
            
                (4)
 Individuals with Down syndrome can attend school, work, make their own life decisions, have meaningful relationships, vote, and contribute to society.
            
            
                (5)
 Individuals with Down syndrome are at an increased risk for certain medical conditions, such as autoimmune disorders, leukemia, congenital heart disease, sleep dysfunction, and Alzheimer’s disease, but may be at a decreased risk for other conditions.
            
            
                (6)
 Research and medical care supporting individuals with Down syndrome and their unique disease profile will improve health outcomes and may potentially lead to treatments for individuals born with or without Down syndrome who suffer from diseases associated with that unique profile.
