No law will eliminate crimes but, at least you as legislators, can assert to the world that you recognize the evil of the present situation and speak your intent to help us overcome discrimination.;Whereas the Alaska Territorial Legislature passed the Anti-Discrimination Act of 1945 on February 16, 1945, which was the first anti-discrimination law enacted in the history of the United States;Whereas Elizabeth dedicated the rest of her life to creating a better Alaska for future generations;Whereas Elizabeth tragically died of cancer in 1958, but her legacy has not been forgotten;Whereas, beginning in 1988, the State of Alaska has recognized February 16 as Elizabeth Peratrovich Day; andWhereas, in 2020, the United States Mint released the Elizabeth Peratrovich $1 coin to commemorate the significant impact that Elizabeth had on advancing equality under the law in the United States: Now, therefore, be it That the Senate—(1)designates February 16, 2025, as National Elizabeth Peratrovich Day;(2)calls on the people of the United States to observe National Elizabeth Peratrovich Day by remembering the work of Elizabeth Wanamaker Peratrovich and other civil rights leaders; and(3)encourages the people of the United States and Members of Congress to commemorate the life and civil rights advocacy of Elizabeth Wanamaker Peratrovich by continuing the important work of ensuring equality for Alaska Natives and Native Americans.
