IV119th CONGRESS1st SessionH. RES. 657IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESAugust 15, 2025Ms. Kaptur (for herself, Mrs. Dingell, Mrs. Beatty, Mr. Pocan, Mr. Vargas, Mr. Horsford, Mr. Vicente Gonzalez of Texas, and Mr. Landsman) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Ways and Means, and in addition to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concernedRESOLUTIONAffirming the President’s promise not to raise the Social Security and Medicare retirement age. 
Whereas, on July 8, 2024, President Donald J. Trump promised to oppose any changes to the retirement age for Social Security and Medicare; Whereas Social Security and Medicare represent solemn commitments made to generations of American workers who paid into these systems with the promise that they would receive a secure retirement and access to healthcare in their later years; 
Whereas nonpartisan data from the Congressional Budget Office and other independent research institutions demonstrate that raising the retirement age would reduce benefits for millions of Americans, particularly impacting those in physically demanding jobs and lower-income communities who experience shorter life expectancies; Whereas the current full retirement age for Social Security has already increased from 65 to 67 for individuals born after 1960, placing an undue burden on seniors and near-retirees who cannot wait longer for their earned benefits; 

 Whereas, among Social Security beneficiaries age 65 and older, 39 percent of men and 44 percent of women receive 50 percent or more of their income from Social Security and therefore depend on access to this hard earned benefit;
     
Whereas more than 4,100,000 Americans will turn 65 each year through 2027, and many will rely on Medicare at the age of 65 to ensure access to life-saving healthcare treatments and preventive services, and raising the eligibility age would lead to higher out-of-pocket costs and reduced access to care; and Whereas increasing the retirement age would amount to an effective benefit cut for current and future retirees, in direct contradiction to the promises made by elected leaders from both parties: Now, therefore, be it 
That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that— (1)the retirement age for Social Security and Medicare shall not be raised; 
(2)Congress must uphold the commitment made to America’s seniors by preserving the current eligibility ages for Social Security and Medicare; (3)any proposals to reduce or delay access to earned retirement benefits shall be firmly rejected; and 
(4)they reaffirm their dedication to maintaining the Social Security and Medicare retirement ages, consistent with President Trump’s stated commitment.
