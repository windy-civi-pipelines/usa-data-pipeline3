Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Nurses for Under-Resourced Schools Everywhere Act or the NURSE Act.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following: 
(1)The National Association of School Nurses identifies schools as primary locations to address student health issues. Since a school nurse is the health care provider that many students see on the most regular basis, it is the position of National Association of School Nurses that a professional registered school nurse be present in every school all day, every day. (2)The American Academy of Pediatrics has recognized the crucial role that school nurses play in children’s health and has called for having a full-time school nurse every day and in every school building. 
(3)The school nurse functions as the leader and coordinator of the school health services team, including by carrying out chronic disease management and health promotion as well as facilitating access to a medical home for each child and supporting academic achievement. (4)With over 25 percent of students managing chronic conditions such as asthma, diabetes, and epilepsy, the presence of a school nurse ensures these children can thrive in a safe and supportive environment. 
(5)A 2024 Morning Consult public-opinion poll conducted to understand the public perception of school nursing found that 87 percent of adults in the United States have a favorable view of school nurses. (6)According to data from the National Association of School Nurses, one-third of schools do not have a school nurse. 
(7)The American Federation of Teachers has called for a nurse in every school, as nurses are frontline workers that address an array of health needs and their presence in a school can help to improve student learning. (8)School nurses promote wellness and disease prevention to improve health outcomes for our Nation’s children. In addition, school nurses perform early intervention services such as periodic assessments for vision, hearing, and dental problems, in an effort to remove barriers to learning. 
(9)The National Association of School Nurses has reported that medication administration to students is one of the most common health-related activities performed in school. As more chronically ill and medically unstable children enter the school system each year, the medical factors that promote and support their academic success increase, including the need for medications that enhance overall health or stabilize chronic conditions. (10)According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, students today face increased social and emotional issues, which enhance the need for preventive services and interventions for acute and chronic health issues. School nurses are actively engaged members of school-based mental health teams and spend nearly 32 percent of their time providing mental health services, including universal and targeted interventions, screenings to identify early warning signs and provide referrals to medical providers, and crisis planning. 
(11)Communicable and infectious diseases account for millions of school days lost each year. Data illustrates that when students have access to a registered nurse in school, immunization rates increase.
