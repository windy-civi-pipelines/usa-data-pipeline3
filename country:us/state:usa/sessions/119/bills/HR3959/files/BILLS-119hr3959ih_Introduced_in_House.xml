 <text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Following No-Action Letters issued on September 24, 2021, and December 16, 2021, the Securities and Exchange Commission indicated that it would apply Rule 15c2–11 to fixed-income markets in a manner that made significant changes to long-standing regulatory requirements, without a rulemaking process, without analysis of the costs and benefits of the action, and without regard for the input of the public. According to a subsequent No-Action Letter, which was issued on November 30, 2022, the Securities and Exchange Commission will apply Rule 15c2–11 to fixed-income securities sold pursuant to Rule 144A after no-action relief expired on January 4, 2025.</text>
