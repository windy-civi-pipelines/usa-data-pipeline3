        119th CONGRESS
        1st Session
        S. RES. 309
        IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
        
            June 26 (legislative day, June 24),
                2025
            Mr. Tuberville (for himself and
                    Mrs. Britt) submitted the following
                resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and
                Transportation
        
        RESOLUTION
        Commemorating the 65th anniversary of the Marshall Space
            Flight Center and recognizing its continued leadership in the development of the Space
            Launch System and human space exploration.
    
    
        
 Whereas the Marshall Space Flight Center (referred to in this preamble as MSFC), located in Huntsville, Alabama, was officially established on July 1, 1960, as one of the premier centers for spaceflight research and development of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (referred to in this preamble as NASA);
        
        
 Whereas MSFC played a pivotal role in the historic Apollo program, designing and developing the Saturn V rocket that carried astronauts to the Moon, and marked a defining achievement in the scientific and engineering excellence of the United States;
        
        
 Whereas MSFC has consistently led innovation and mission support for critical NASA programs, including Skylab, the first space station of the United States, the Hubble Space Telescope, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, and numerous other scientific payloads that have revolutionized understanding of the universe;
        
        
 Whereas MSFC has provided engineering leadership, payload integration, and science operations in support of the International Space Station (commonly referred to as the ISS), helping maintain a continuous human presence in space since the year 2000;
        
        
 Whereas MSFC continues to serve as the lead center for the development and integration of the Space Launch System (referred to in this preamble as the SLS), the most powerful launch vehicle developed by NASA since Saturn V, and a cornerstone of the Artemis program;
        
        
 Whereas the SLS represents the commitment of the United States to returning humans to the Moon, preparing for future crewed missions to Mars, and expanding deep space exploration for generations to come;
        
        
 Whereas the leadership of MSFC in the SLS program exemplifies the unmatched technical expertise of MSFC in large-scale propulsion systems, systems integration, and complex spaceflight engineering;
        
        
 Whereas MSFC continues to serve as an anchor for the aerospace industry and STEM education in the Tennessee Valley region and beyond, providing high-tech jobs, economic opportunity, and outreach to schools and universities; and
        
        
 Whereas MSFC is home to a dedicated workforce committed to excellence, safety, integrity, and teamwork: Now, therefore, be it
        
    
    
        
            
 That the Senate—  (1) commemorates the 65th anniversary of the establishment of the Marshall Space Flight Center (referred to in this resolution as MSFC);
            
            
                (2)
 recognizes the historical legacy and critical contributions of MSFC to the leadership of the United States in space exploration over the past 65 years;
            
            
                (3)
 commends the continued excellence and leadership of the MSFC in the development and integration of the Space Launch System (commonly referred to as the SLS) as the leading technology for deep space exploration;
            
            
                (4)
 reaffirms the strong support of the Senate for the ongoing mission of the MSFC and the broader goals of the Artemis program at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (commonly referred to as NASA) and beyond; and
            
            
                (5)
 honors the commitment, skill, and innovation of the engineers, scientists, technicians, and support staff who have contributed to the mission of MSFC to advance spaceflight for the United States.
