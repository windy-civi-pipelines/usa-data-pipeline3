Whereas progressive supranuclear palsy, often referred to as PSP, is an adult onset neurodegenerative disorder that affects multiple areas of the brain and causes complex symptoms and care needs; Whereas, although some symptoms may appear similar to that of Parkinson’s disease, progressive supranuclear palsy is a distinct disease that is part of a family of conditions clinically defined as atypical Parkinsonism;
Whereas, while estimates vary and the disorder is often misdiagnosed, approximately 30,000 Americans are living with progressive supranuclear palsy; Whereas the symptoms of progressive supranuclear palsy can include cognitive impairment, gait and balance difficulties, speech and swallowing difficulties, stiffness, changes in personality, changes in vision, depression, and a variety of other symptoms that can have a severe impact on an individual’s quality of life and life expectancy;
Whereas progressive supranuclear palsy is aggressive in its progression, with most patients becoming dependent on care in 3 to 4 years; Whereas there is currently no disease-modifying treatments and no known cure for progressive supranuclear palsy;
Whereas progressive supranuclear palsy is believed to be caused by a combination of environmental factors and genetics, but the exact cause is still unknown; Whereas there are thousands of family caregivers, friends, and loved ones whose lives are greatly affected by progressive supranuclear palsy;
Whereas additional research, support services, and education are needed to maintain quality of life for those affected by the disease, reduce delays to diagnosis and access to proper care, lead to better treatments, and find a cure for progressive supranuclear palsy; and Whereas the establishment of the month of May 2025 as Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Awareness Month will benefit patients, families, health care professionals, and communities across the country and further bolster awareness of the disorder: Now, therefore, be it 
That the House of Representatives— (1)supports the designation of Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Awareness Month;
(2)supports the goals and ideals of Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Awareness Month; (3)supports research to find better treatments and a cure for progressive supranuclear palsy; and
(4)commends the researchers, volunteers, organizations, families, and individuals across the country who are working to improve the lives of people living with progressive supranuclear palsy.
