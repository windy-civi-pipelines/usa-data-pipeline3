Section 2:
Article I: Abuse of PowerSenior District Judge Charles R.

Through his conduct, in which he violated his oath to the Constitution and duty of impartiality to the people of the United States, Senior District Judge Charles R. Breyer has abused the powers of his judicial authority, having engaged in actions that prioritize political gain over the duty of impartiality owed to the public and litigants as follows: (1)Senior District Judge Charles R. Breyer attempted to use his power to prevent President Trump from using the National Guard to enforce the law in Los Angeles, California. (2)Senior District Judge Charles R. Breyer required President Trump to ignore the Constitution of the United States to return the National Guard to the Governor of California. This conduct jeopardizes the safety of the Nation, represents an abuse of judicial power, and is detrimental to the orderly functioning of the judiciary. Using the powers of his office, Senior District Judge Charles R. Breyer has attempted to seize power from the executive branch and interfere with the will of the American people. In so doing, Senior District Judge Charles R. Breyer used the powers of his position to engage in actions that overstep his judicial authority. By making a political decision outside the scope of his judicial duties, he compromised the impartiality of our judicial system and created a constitutional crisis. Wherefore, Senior District Judge Charles R. Breyer is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors and should be removed from office.
