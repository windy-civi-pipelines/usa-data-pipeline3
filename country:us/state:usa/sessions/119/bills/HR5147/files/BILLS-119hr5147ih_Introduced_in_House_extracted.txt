2.Preservation of local zoning authoritySection 332(c) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 332(c)) is amended by striking paragraph (7) and inserting the following:

(7)Preservation of local zoning authority
(A)General authorityExcept as provided in this paragraph, nothing in this Act shall limit or affect the authority of a State or local government or instrumentality thereof over decisions regarding the placement, construction, or modification of personal wireless service facilities. (B)Limitations (i)In generalThe regulation of the placement, construction, or modification of a personal wireless service facility by any State or local government or instrumentality thereof—
(I)shall not discriminate among personal wireless service facilities or providers of communications service, including by providing exclusive or preferential use of facilities to a particular provider or class of providers of personal wireless service; and (II)shall not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision, improvement, or enhancement of personal wireless service.

(vii)FeesTo the extent permitted by law, a State or local government or instrumentality thereof may charge a fee to consider a request for authorization to place, construct, or modify a personal wireless service facility or a fee for use of a right-of-way or a facility in a right-of-way owned or managed by the government or instrumentality for the placement, construction, or modification of a personal wireless service facility, if the fee is—
