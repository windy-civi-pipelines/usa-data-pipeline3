Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Rosie the Riveter Commemorative Coin Act.

Section 2:
2.FindingsThe Congress finds the following:(1)During World War II, more than six million American women entered the workforce to fill the vacancies left by men who had joined the Armed Forces and support the Home Front. Millions of women already working outside the home shifted to employment in critical industries to support the war effort.(2)Women went to work or volunteer full-time in factories, farms, shipyards, banks, and other institutions in support of the U.S. military overseas. They worked with the United Service Organizations and the American Red Cross, drove street cars, riveted airplane parts, collected critical materials, rolled bandages, and served on rationing boards.(3)This women workforce met not only the ever-growing demands for war materials, including equipment, weaponry, ammunition, and military rations, but also the demand for support services in schools, hospitals, and offices.(4)Collectively, the American women who held employment or volunteered in support of the war effort during World War II have been represented by the iconic image of Rosie the Riveter.(5)As riveters, welders, and other laborers, a diverse women workforce played an integral part in shipyards, aircraft factories, and other areas of the defense industrial base.(6)Women in the workforce faced the double burden of responsibilities on the job and at home as the primary caregivers and wage earners during World War II.(7)Rosies persevered often in the face of harassment, discrimination, and prejudice to support their country and families in a time of great need. Despite equal pay regulations, women were regularly paid 10 to 15 cents an hour lower than their male counterparts even during wartime.(8)Black, Latina, Indigenous, Asian American, and Pacific Islander Rosies were subjected to racist discrimination, violence, and harassment at work, at home, and in public. Women of color overcame long-held policies of discrimination and racial segregation to make significant contributions to the war effort and labor market.(9)Our Rosies are a testament to women’s empowerment and the invaluable contribution of women to the American war effort during World War II, inspiring future generations of women and girls.(10)Americans have chosen to honor the women who contributed to the Home Front during World War II, including through the award of a Congressional Gold Medal and the annual celebration of National Rosie the Riveter Day on March 21.(11)The work, sacrifice, and dedication of our Rosies are worthy of national reflection and commemoration.(12)It is fitting and proper to recognize and preserve the history and legacy of American women who contributed to the Home Front during World War II for their patriotic commitment to their country and perseverance in the face of adversity.
