IV119th CONGRESS1st SessionH. RES. 475IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESJune 4, 2025Mrs. Miller of Illinois (for herself, Mr. Cloud, Mr. Moore of Alabama, Mrs. Harshbarger, Mr. Weber of Texas, Mr. Rulli, Mr. Nehls, Ms. Hageman, Mr. Harris of North Carolina, Ms. Tenney, Mr. Davidson, Mr. McGuire, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Grothman, Mr. Gill of Texas, Mr. Loudermilk, Mr. Brecheen, and Ms. Greene of Georgia) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Education and WorkforceRESOLUTIONSupporting the designation of Family Month. 
Whereas the traditional nuclear family is the foundation of a healthy society; Whereas mothers and fathers play a crucial and irreplaceable role in the upbringing of their children; 
Whereas the best environment for children to thrive is a home with a married mother and father; Whereas roughly half of all marriages in the United States end in divorce; 
Whereas many young people are opting to delay or forgo marriage and starting a family; Whereas many tax and welfare policies encourage cohabitation and penalize couples for getting married; 
Whereas the birth rate in the United States has fallen below the replacement level needed to replenish the population and sustain the economy; Whereas the month of June was first declared as Pride Month by President Bill Clinton in 1999 and has been done so by Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, rejecting the importance of marriage and family; 
Whereas Americans are inundated with perverse Pride Month displays and events throughout the month of June that denigrate the nuclear family; Whereas Americans who hold to a traditional view of marriage and family are often disparaged; 
Whereas the decline of marriage and family has corresponded to a rise in crime, drug abuse, and other social ill; Whereas our Founding Father John Adams said, Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.; 
Whereas our survival as a country and civilization depends on the continuation of traditional marriage and family; and Whereas it is fitting to observe a month of rededicating our Nation to the importance of the traditional nuclear family: Now, therefore, be it 
That the House of Representatives— (1)recognizes the benefit of marriage and family to men, women, children, and society; 
(2)no longer recognizes Pride Month; and (3)supports the designation of Family Month for the purpose of rededicating our Nation to the importance of this essential unit.
