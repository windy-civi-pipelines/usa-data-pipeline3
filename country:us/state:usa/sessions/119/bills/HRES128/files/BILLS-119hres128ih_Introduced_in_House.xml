</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas technology-facilitated abuse includes, but is not limited to, cyber extortion, cyberstalking, and doxing;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, according to the Cyberbullying Research Center, over one quarter (28.1 percent) of teens who had been in a romantic relationship at some point in the previous year said they had been the victim of at least one form of digital dating abuse; </text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, while dating violence, domestic violence, sexual violence, and stalking affect individuals regardless of age, teens are especially vulnerable;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, according to the 2019 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, almost half (44.3 percent) of teens experienced at least one type of violence and 1 in 7 (15.6 percent) of teens experienced at least two types of violence;
