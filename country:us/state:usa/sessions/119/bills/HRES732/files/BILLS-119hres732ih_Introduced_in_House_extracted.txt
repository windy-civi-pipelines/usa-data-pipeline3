IV119th CONGRESS1st SessionH. RES. 732IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESSeptember 17, 2025Mr. Kelly of Pennsylvania (for himself, Ms. Wasserman Schultz, Mr. Fitzpatrick, and Mrs. Dingell) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and CommerceRESOLUTIONExpressing support for the designation of September 30, 2025, as Rare Cancer Day to highlight the challenges patients with rare cancers face and to raise awareness and support efforts to improve early diagnosis and treatment.
Whereas, approximately 1 in 5 people living with cancer in the United States is diagnosed with a rare cancer; Whereas all pediatric cancers are rare;
Whereas a quarter of all cancer deaths each year are due to rare cancers; Whereas the 5-year survival rate is lower for patients with a rare cancer than for those diagnosed with a more common cancer;
Whereas the early detection and treatment of rare cancers is challenging for patients, providers, and scientists; Whereas early detection of rare cancers currently is challenging for patients because they are not aware of rare cancer symptoms;
Whereas the length of time that it takes for providers to diagnose a rare cancer is longer than for more common cancers because symptoms may be unusual and less recognizable; Whereas efforts to increase awareness of rare cancer symptoms among patients and clinicians would lead to earlier detection and improvements in survival rates;
Whereas scientific understanding of and the development of effective treatments for many rare cancers are less established than with more common cancers; and Whereas treatment options for many rare cancers currently are more limited than with more common cancers: Now, therefore, be it 
That the House of Representatives— (1)supports designating a Rare Cancer Day;
(2)recognizes the challenges of detecting rare cancer; (3)understands that rare cancer is prevalent among cancer patients;
(4)acknowledges the devastating impact that rare cancer has on individuals; (5)recognizes the low survival rate of individuals with rare cancer compared to more common cancers;
(6)supports increasing awareness of rare cancer symptoms to increase early detection and improve survival rates; (7)encourages partnerships with the medical and scientific fields to improve the early diagnosis of rare cancers and to develop effective treatments to eradicate them; and
(8)supports the dedication of funding to explore cures and treatments for rare cancers.
