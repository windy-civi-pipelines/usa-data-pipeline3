<paragraph id="HC0825B7E497E4F99B55E2BB61C46C486"><enum>(1)</enum><text>In 2023, there were 209,253 cases of syphilis in the United States, the highest number since 1950. This represents an 80 percent increase since 2018 and continuing a decades-long upward trend.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HFBFE7ABBEB3C417D9A629D99FF2620DE"><enum>(2)</enum><text>Untreated, syphilis can seriously damage the heart and brain and can cause blindness, deafness, and paralysis.</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="HB709314CF81F4EB692BF362F75187AB1"><enum>(3)</enum><text>The increased rise in syphilis cases is causing the rise in congenital syphilis with more than 3,882, a 3 percent increase from 2022, resulting in 252 stillbirths and 27 infant deaths.

Congenital syphilis can present health issues for babies at birth, including neonatal death, meningitis, anemia, and problems with the spleen and liver. If not treated, congenital syphilis can cause bone and joint problems, vision and hearing problems, issues with the nervous system, and developmental delays.</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="H0DFAF4D829544F50B14EB5E4C334B5CE"><enum>(5)</enum><text>High incidence rates of congenital syphilis are often due to lack of timely testing or inadequate treatment during pregnancy.
