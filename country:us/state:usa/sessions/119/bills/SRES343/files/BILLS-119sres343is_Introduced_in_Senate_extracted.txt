124 Stat. 119) (referred to in this preamble as the ACA) reauthorized the Task Force and required insurers to cover, without deductible or copay, preventive services that are recommended by the Task Force with a grade of A or B, along with those preventive services recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (referred to in this preamble as ACIP), Bright Futures, and the Health Resources and Services Administration’s guidelines for women’s health;Whereas the ACA prohibits most health plans, including private health insurance plans, Medicare, and Medicaid, from imposing cost-sharing on patients for preventive services when the services are delivered by an in-network provider;Whereas the Task Force comprehensively assesses evidence and makes recommendations about the effectiveness of clinical primary and secondary preventive services, including screening tests, counseling about healthy behaviors, and preventive medications for children, adolescents, adults, older adults, and pregnant women, which collectively includes 54 recommended preventive services and medicines that are covered without cost-sharing;Whereas such recommended services include preventive health services such as screenings for heart disease, screenings for breast, colorectal, cervical, and lung cancer, and folic acid supplements for women to prevent birth defects in their babies;Whereas the most common causes of chronic disease in the United States include smoking, obesity, high blood sugar, hypertension, and high cholesterol, and the Task Force has made recommendations regarding prevention of all of those causes for both children and adults;Whereas the Task Force recommendations are entirely based on the strength of the evidence and the balance of benefits and harms of a preventive service;Whereas the Task Force has saved hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of lives due to its often simple and inexpensive recommendations;Whereas preventive services can help people avoid acute illness, identify and treat chronic conditions, prevent cancer or lead to earlier detection, improve health outcomes, and reduce the burden of end-stage chronic disease;Whereas the Task Force is comprised of members selected, reviewed, and appointed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services;Whereas nominations for members of the Task Force are open to the public, and qualification includes demonstrated knowledge, expertise, and national leadership in areas including—(1)the critical evaluation of research published in peer-reviewed literature and in the methods of evidence review;(2)clinical prevention, health promotion, and primary health care;(3)implementation of evidence-based recommendations in clinical practice, including at the clinician-patient level, practice level, and health system level; and(4)experience in methodological issues, such as meta-analysis, analytic modeling, or clinical epidemiology, for members without primary health care clinical experience;Whereas the members of the Task Force are appointed for staggered 4-year terms, with potential 1-year extensions, to allow new perspectives into the Task Force while ensuring continuity in its mission;Whereas applicants for the Task Force are required to not have substantial conflicts of interest, whether financial, professional, or intellectual, that would impair the scientific integrity of the work of the Task Force, and must complete regular conflict of interest disclosures;Whereas the Task Force is assisted in fulfilling its mission by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (referred to in this preamble as the AHRQ), which provides scientific, administrative, and dissemination support to the Task Force, and by AHRQ-designated Evidence-based Practice Centers, which develop the evidence reviews, evidence summaries, and other documents that inform the deliberations of the Task Force;Whereas recent funding and staffing reductions at AHRQ have significantly impacted its ability to support the Task Force;Whereas the recent decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in Kennedy v.
