As James M. Boughton has noted in his Silent Revolution: The International Monetary Fund 1979–1989, even as the PRC was seated, the United States Executive Director to the IMF, Sam Y. Cross, expressed support on behalf of the United States Government for <quote>some kind of association between Taiwan and the Fund</quote>.</text></paragraph>

According to Mr. Gold, <quote>the desire to give the Fund flexibility in dealing with applications may explain not only the absence of any adjective that qualifies <quote>countries</quote> but also the choice of that word itself</quote>.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H4D37009FA1C24158A1455C9257176A76"><enum>(12)</enum><text>In his IMF study, Mr. Gold further observes, <quote>in the practice of the Fund the concepts of independence and sovereignty have been avoided on the whole as a mode of expressing a criterion for membership in the Fund</quote>. He continues, <quote>Although the Fund usually takes into account the recognition or nonrecognition of an entity as a state, there are no rules or even informal understandings on the extent to which an applicant must have been recognized by members or other international organizations before the Fund will regard it as eligible for membership.</quote>. In fact, when considering an application for membership where the status of an applicant may not be resolved, Mr. Gold writes <quote>there have been occasions on which the Fund has made a finding before decisions had been taken by the United Nations or by most members or by members with a majority of the total voting power.</quote> Mr. Gold concludes, <quote>the Fund makes its own findings on whether an applicant is a <quote>country</quote>, and makes them solely for its own purposes.</quote>.</text></paragraph>

Secretary of State Blinken noted, <quote>As the international community faces an unprecedented number of complex and global issues, it is critical for all stakeholders to help address these problems. This includes the 24 million people who live in Taiwan. Taiwan’s meaningful participation in the UN system is not a political issue, but a pragmatic one.</quote>.
