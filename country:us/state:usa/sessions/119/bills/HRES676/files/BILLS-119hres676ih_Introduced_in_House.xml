Gordon-Bray; however, Retired Brigadier General Bray told the Daytona Beach News-Journal in August 2024 that he did not sign a Bronze Star recommendation for Representative Cory Mills;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas five people who served with Representative Cory Mills, including two men who were reported as having been personally saved by Representative Cory Mills at great risk to his own life as a basis for the recommendation for his Bronze Star in the Department of the Army Form 638, disputed that Representative Cory Mills was involved in their rescue or provided life-saving care;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas one Private First Class cited as having been involved in one of the listed achievements on Representative Cory Mills’s Army Form 638 recommending him for a Bronze Star denied that Representative Cory Mills provided him any aid and also denied that his injuries were life threatening;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas one Sergeant cited as having been involved in one of the listed achievements on Representative Cory Mills’s Army Form 638 recommending him for a Bronze Star called the account a <quote>fabrication</quote> and claimed that he <quote>was not involved in any claims that Cory Mills makes about me</quote>; and</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, despite the numerous available contradictions of the accounts forming the basis of the recommendation for his Bronze Star, Representative Cory Mills described the legitimate factual disputes raised by individuals he purportedly served with and rescued as <quote>slander and defamation</quote> in a statement to the Daytona Beach News Journal: Now, therefore, be it</text></whereas></preamble><resolution-body style="traditional" id="H09A5C7703633474381EA3DB454D187A7"><section id="H926546AB92FB417A94FB1A105C6C03E1" section-type="undesignated-section" display-inline="yes-display-inline"><enum/><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">That—</text><paragraph id="H146B0651CCF74466B97B6A44F4BEAF5C"><enum>(1)</enum><text>Representative Cory Mills be censured;</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H05CA2B8F47C845BBB6565E5A0B46F38C"><enum>(2)</enum><text>Representative Cory Mills forthwith present himself in the well of the House of Representatives for the pronouncement of censure; and</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HF7838ADD97F046ADBA871D33CCC1D686"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Representative Cory Mills be censured with the public reading of this resolution by the Speaker.</text></paragraph></section></resolution-body></resolution>
