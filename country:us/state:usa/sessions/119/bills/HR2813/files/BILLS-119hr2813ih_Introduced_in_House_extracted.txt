Section 4:
4.Published guidance on small modular reactorsThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Secretary of Energy shall revise Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Department of Energy guidance relating to maximum electrical output of small modular reactors and microreactors to align such guidance with the definitions of small modular reactor and microreactor in section 7 of this Act.

Section 5:
5.Financial assistance eligibility for efficient small modular reactor development, demonstration, and deployment (a)In generalNotwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of Energy, in providing any funding assistance to support the development, demonstration, or deployment of grid-scale small modular reactors, shall not exclude from award eligibility projects or reactor technologies on the basis that a single reactor unit output exceeds any electrical megawatt threshold between 50 and 500 electrical megawatts. 
(b)Treatment of existing programsNothing in this section shall be construed as limiting the authority of the Secretary of Energy to make awards within the explicit scope of Department of Energy solicitations issued prior to the date of enactment of this Act.

Section 6:
6.Small modular reactor commercialization and industrialization competitiveness working group (a)In generalThe Secretary of Energy shall establish a working group to be known as the Small Modular Reactor Commercialization and Industrialization Competitiveness Working Group (in this section referred to as the Working Group). 
(b)DutiesThe duties of the Working Group shall include the following: (1)To identify small modular reactor technologies the design for which an application has been submitted or received approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or a foreign nuclear regulator with a signed memorandum of cooperation with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 
(2)To assess, and recommend initiatives to improve, the ability of the United States to— (A)serve as the preeminent geography to commercialize small modular reactor technologies after initial or first-of-a-kind deployment; and 
(B)secure and attract long-term manufacturing industrial base investment in small modular reactor fabrication. (3)To recommend policy changes that would improve the ability of the United States to host the manufacturing of small modular reactor technologies identified in paragraph (1) that are undergoing first-of-a-kind deployment outside of the United States. 
(4)To assess, and recommend initiatives to improve, workforce readiness in the United States to enable small modular reactor commercialization at scale. (5)To identify strategic research objectives supporting industrialization and small modular reactor fabrication cost-reduction following first-of-a-kind reactor deployment.  
(c)ChairpersonThe Secretary of Energy, or a designee of the Secretary, shall serve as the Chairperson of the Working Group. (d)Membership (1)Mandatory membersThe Working Group shall be composed of, at a minimum, representatives from— 
(A)the Department of Energy (including, as the Secretary of Energy determines appropriate, offices in such Department, such as the Office of Nuclear Energy and any National Laboratory);  (B)the Department of Defense; 
(C)the Department of State; (D)the Department of Commerce; 
(E)the Department of the Interior;  (F)the Department of the Treasury; and  
(G)the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  (2)Additional membersThe Secretary of Energy may add members to the Working Group, as the Secretary determines appropriate.    
(e)Annual reportNot later than December 1 of each year through 2030, the Secretary of Energy shall submit a report to the Committees on Science, Space, and Technology and Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate on the findings and recommendations of the Working Group.

Section 7:
7.DefinitionsIn this Act: 
(1)Advanced nuclear reactorThe term advanced nuclear reactor has the meaning given such term in section 951(b)(1) of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 16271(b)(1)). (2)MicroreactorThe term microreactor means an advanced nuclear reactor with a rated capacity of less than 50 electrical megawatts. 
(3)Small modular reactorThe term small modular reactor means an advanced nuclear reactor— (A)with a rated capacity of less than 500 electrical megawatts; and 
(B)that can be constructed and operated in combination with similar reactors at a single site.
