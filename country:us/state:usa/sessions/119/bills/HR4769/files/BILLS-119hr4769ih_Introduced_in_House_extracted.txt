Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Foster Youth Mentoring Act of 2025.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress makes the following findings:
(1)Positive relationships are important for children and youth. An estimated 20 percent of youth do not have caring adults in their lives, representing 8,500,000 youth. Children who have a positive caring relationship with an adult can also benefit from additional positive relationships. (2)Research shows that mentors make a difference in young people’s lives. At-risk youth who have mentors are 55 percent more likely to enroll in college. Students who meet regularly with their mentors are 52 percent less likely than their peers to skip a day of school. Youth who have mentors are also 75 percent more likely to hold a leadership position in a club or sports team.
(3)Young people that have mentors have improved relationships with adults, fewer disciplinary referrals, and more confidence in achieving their goals. (4)In 2021, 391,311 youth were in foster care. Of those youth, 86,793 were between the ages of 11 and 15, and 55,396 were between the ages of 16 and 20.
(5)Mentoring programs that serve foster youth are unique and require additional considerations, including specialized training and support necessary to provide for consistent, long-term relationships for children in foster care. (6)Mentoring programs can be used as an effective strategy to support positive outcomes for foster youth, such as improved mental health, reductions in substance misuse, and increased life satisfaction. Additionally, mentoring relationships are associated with supporting fewer placement changes for youth and improved use of transition services when exiting foster care.
(7)Mentoring programs targeting youth experiencing multiple risk factors, community-based programs, and programs lasting 1 year or more are more effective in supporting youth in foster care. (8)Mentored youth showed lower rates of involvement in the juvenile justice system and lower rates of involvement in the legal system as adults.
(9)Increasing evidence is showing that peer mentoring and support can be very effective in engaging young people. Alumni of and youth in foster care have noted the importance of the support and service delivery by individuals with lived experience, including peers.
