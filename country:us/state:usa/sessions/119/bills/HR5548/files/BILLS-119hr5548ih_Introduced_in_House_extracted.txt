================================================================================

Section 1:
1.Short title
 This Act may be cited as the Fraud Accountability and Recovery Act.

Section 2:
2.Prohibition on assistanceSection 620 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2370) is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:  (z)No assistance shall be furnished under this Act to the government of any country the President determines—

Section 3:
3.FindingsCongress finds the following:  (1) According to the Government Accountability Office, the Federal Government lost between $233,000,000,000 and $521,000,000,000 annually to fraud from fiscal years 2018 through 2022.
       

        (2)

        (3)
 In Minnesota, the nonprofit organization Feeding Our Future and associated individuals carried out the largest COVID–19 pandemic fraud scheme in the United States, stealing over $250,000,000 intended to feed hungry children.
       
(4)The Department of Justice has charged 75 defendants in the fraud scheme, and Federal prosecutors have secured multiple convictions against participants in this scheme, which involved the submission of false reimbursement claims, the creation of fictitious meal sites, and the laundering of Federal funds through shell entities and fraudulent invoices. (5)Charges and convictions in the Feeding Our Future scheme include— 
(A)wire fraud; (B)conspiracy to commit wire fraud; 
(C)theft of government funds; (D)conspiracy to defraud the United States;

Section 4:
4.Sense of CongressIt is the sense of Congress as follows: (1)The United States lacks adequate tools to ensure the recovery of stolen taxpayer funds and property transferred overseas, leaving American taxpayers without recourse when foreign jurisdictions fail to cooperate. 
(2)Strengthening program integrity, recouping stolen funds, and preventing individuals convicted of defrauding Federal programs from seeking international harbor are essential to safeguarding taxpayer dollars and ensuring programs assist those that Congress intended. (3)Providing additional deterrence by ensuring potential fraudsters lack a safe harbor abroad is critical to preventing future fraud schemes.

Section 5:
5.Waiver 
(a)In generalThe President may waive the limitation under section 620(z) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as added by section 2, if the President certifies to Congress that prohibiting such assistance is contrary to the national security of the United States.
