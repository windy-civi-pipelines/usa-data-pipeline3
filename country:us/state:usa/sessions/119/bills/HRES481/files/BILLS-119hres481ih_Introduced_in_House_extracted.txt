IV119th CONGRESS1st SessionH. RES. 481IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESJune 5, 2025Mr. Van Drew (for himself, Mr. Allen, Mr. Bacon, Mr. Babin, Ms. Boebert, Mr. Burchett, Mr. Calvert, Ms. DeGette, Mr. Ezell, Mr. Feenstra, Mr. Figures, Mr. Fleischmann, Mr. Fitzpatrick, Mr. Fulcher, Mr. Garbarino, Mr. Goldman of Texas, Mr. Tony Gonzales of Texas, Mr. Gooden, Mr. Green of Tennessee, Mr. Guest, Mr. Hamadeh of Arizona, Mr. Harrigan, Mrs. Harshbarger, Mr. Issa, Mr. Jackson of Texas, Mr. Kustoff, Mr. LaMalfa, Mr. Lawler, Mrs. Luna, Ms. Maloy, Mr. Meuser, Mr. Moore of North Carolina, Mr. Moolenaar, Mr. Moskowitz, Mr. Nadler, Mr. Neguse, Mr. Norman, Mr. Ogles, Mr. Owens, Ms. Pettersen, Mr. Schneider, Mr. Self, Mr. Smith of New Jersey, Mr. Stauber, Ms. Tenney, Mr. Turner of Ohio, Mrs. Wagner, Ms. Wasserman Schultz, Mr. Webster of Florida, Mr. Williams of Texas, Mr. Wittman, Mr. Yakym, Mr. Evans of Colorado, and Mr. Crow) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the JudiciaryRESOLUTIONCondemning the rise in ideologically motivated attacks on Jewish individuals in the United States, including the recent violent assault in Boulder, Colorado, and reaffirming the House of Representatives commitment to combating antisemitism and politically motivated violence. 
Whereas, on June 1, 2025, in Boulder, Colorado, a peaceful gathering held by the group Run for Their Lives was violently attacked by an individual armed with incendiary devices, resulting in multiple injuries, including to elderly participants, in what authorities have called a targeted, ideologically motivated act of terrorism; Whereas this attack represents the latest in a growing trend of politically and religiously motivated violence directed at Jewish individuals and institutions across the United States; 

 Whereas, on May 21, 2025, two Israeli Embassy staff members—Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim—were fatally shot outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, DC, following a reception for diplomats, and the suspect shouted Free, free Palestine! during his arrest;
     
Whereas, on April 13, 2025, an individual set multiple fires using incendiary devices at the Pennsylvania Governor’s Residence while Governor Josh Shapiro and his family were inside following a Passover Seder; the suspect, motivated by hostility toward the Governor’s stance on Israel and Palestinians, admitted intent to cause harm and now faces charges including attempted murder, terrorism, and arson; Whereas these attacks, though distinct in method and geography, share a common pattern of targeting Jewish individuals or symbols of Jewish life and civic engagement; 
Whereas no American should be subjected to violence or intimidation because of their religion, heritage, or peaceful advocacy; and Whereas acts of antisemitism—whether expressed through threats, vandalism, or violence—are fundamentally incompatible with the values of the United States and must be condemned unequivocally: Now, therefore, be it 
That the House of Representatives— (1)condemns in the strongest possible terms the June 1, 2025, targeted act of terror in Boulder, Colorado, as a cowardly act of ideologically motivated violence; 
(2)recognizes this attack as part of a disturbing pattern of targeted aggression against Jewish individuals in the United States; (3)reaffirms its commitment to protecting the rights of all Americans to assemble peacefully and practice their faith without fear of violence; 
(4)calls on Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies to ensure thorough investigation and prosecution of all such incidents; and (5)urges elected officials, community leaders, and civil society to speak out against antisemitism and politically motivated violence in all forms.
