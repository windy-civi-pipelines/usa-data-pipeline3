IV119th CONGRESS1st SessionH. RES. 573IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESJuly 10, 2025Mrs. Kim (for herself and Mrs. Foushee) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and CommerceRESOLUTIONRecognizing World Misophonia Awareness Day. 
Whereas World Misophonia Awareness Day is recognized each year on July 9; Whereas misophonia, or sound sensitivity syndrome, is a condition characterized by strong emotional and physical reactions such as anxiety, anger, or disgust caused by specific sounds that typically do not bother others; 
Whereas misophonia is associated with abnormal connectivity in the brain between sensory processing regions and areas responsible for emotion regulation, which may contribute to the intense reactions to benign stimuli; Whereas commonly reported triggers include eating and drinking noises, heavy breathing and throat sounds, repetitive or mechanical sounds, and animal or environmental noises; 
Whereas symptoms of misophonia manifest emotionally, physically, and behaviorally, including through increased heart rate, blood pressure, and a fight-or-flight response when exposed to trigger sounds; Whereas misophonia typically starts to express itself between the ages of 9 and 13 and can be lifelong as no evidence-based treatment exists yet; 
Whereas it is estimated that 4.6 percent of adults in the United States may experience misophonia, which would indicate a serious health concern; Whereas misophonia may also occur concurrently with other mental health conditions, including generalized anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and depression; 
Whereas misophonia can significantly impact mental health, quality of life, and daily functioning due to its unpredictable and nonpreventable nature; Whereas although misophonia is not currently listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM–5), research points to its association with heightened brain activity in regions responsible for emotional processing; and 
Whereas increased public awareness, research funding, and clinical recognition are essential to better understand misophonia and to improve support for those living with misophonia: Now, therefore, be it That the House of Representatives— 
(1)recognizes World Misophonia Awareness Day to increase awareness and understanding of misophonia as a legitimate mental disorder that affects social and emotional well being; (2)supports further research into the causes, prevalence, and treatment options for misophonia, including its neurological and genetic components; 
(3)supports efforts to provide training to healthcare workers and mental health professionals on recognizing the effects and signs of misophonia to ensure timely, compassionate care; and (4)encourages the development of accommodations to those suffering with misophonia.
