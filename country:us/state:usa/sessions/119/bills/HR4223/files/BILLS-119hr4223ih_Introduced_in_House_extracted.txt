Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Gun Records Restoration and Preservation Act.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds as follows: (1)The Tiahrt Amendments prevent the collection of valuable information, and the establishment of effective policies to prevent illegal guns from being used in crimes.
(2)The Tiahrt Amendments impede enforcement of the gun laws by requiring most background check records to be destroyed within 24 hours, and by barring the Federal Government from requiring annual inventory audits by owners of gun shops. (3)A 2012 study by researchers at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health found that the Tiahrt Amendments dramatically increase gun trafficking to the criminal market.
(4)A 2016 study from the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health found that in 2008, 79 percent of all guns recovered by police from crime scenes belonged to someone other than the perpetrator—30 percent had been stolen. (5)A 2020 analysis from the RAND corporation concluded that the Tiahrt Amendments limit researchers’ access to data that provide important insights, such as—
(A)how guns flow from States with less restrictive gun laws to States with more restrictive gun laws; (B)how prohibited purchasers obtain their firearms;
(C)the characteristics of straw purchases; and (D)whether more restrictive gun laws create a shortage of firearms for prohibited purchases.
(6)Every year, more than 165,000 people are shot in the United States. (7)2020 was one of the deadliest years on record for the United States, with an estimated 21,000 people killed in firearm homicides or non-suicide related shootings, which is a 33-percent increase over 2019.
(8)In 2020, 62 percent of firearm homicide victims were Black and 15 percent of firearm homicide victims were Hispanic. (9)In 2020, the National Tracing Center at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives processed 490,800 trace requests on firearms from Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies.
(10)Having effective policies to prevent illegal gun trafficking makes our families and communities safer. (11)Repealing the Tiahrt Amendments would support law enforcement efforts and give the public vital information needed to craft the most effective policies against illegal guns.
