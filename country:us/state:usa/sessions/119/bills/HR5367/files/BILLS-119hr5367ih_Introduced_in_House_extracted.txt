Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Capital for Beginning Farmers and Ranchers Act of 2025.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds that— 
(1)beginning farmers and ranchers often pursue business models featuring diverse and specialized production and marketing strategies; (2)diverse and specialized agricultural businesses typically require substantial early-stage investments which will benefit the operation for years to come; and 
(3)programs in effect as of 2025 often finance those multi-year investments as annual operating loans, resulting in beginning farmers and ranchers under-investing in critical start-up capacities, limiting the ability of beginning farmers and ranchers to accumulate working capital, and increasing the difficulties faced by beginning farmers and ranchers in meeting the terms of those loans.

Section 3:
