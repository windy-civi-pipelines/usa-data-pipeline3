African and Asian elephants have been demonstrated to possess, amongst other things, intentional communication and learning, memory, and categorization abilities. An Emory University experiment showed that a female elephant seemed to recognize herself in a mirror, a result attributed to self-awareness only seen otherwise in humans, dolphins, and chimpanzees.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H37C7C6E806DD41B0B22F60189E4D77FE"><enum>(2)</enum><text>Captivity does not provide for the needs of normal elephant behavior and reproduction. As a result, captive elephants suffer both physical and emotional trauma including hernias, arthritis, mental degradation, and high calf mortality. The average lifespan of a captive elephant is 17 years; in the wild, elephants can live for 50 years or more.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H6A35FC71264E456894CB2273892B6868"><enum>(3)</enum><text>It is estimated that the cost of caring for an elephant in captivity can be up to $100,000 per year. In 2004, the Detroit Zoo became the first major American zoo to shut down its elephant exhibit on ethical grounds. In 2006, the Bronx Zoo announced that it would close its exhibit once its three elephants died. Since the early 1990s, more than 22 zoos have shut down their elephant exhibits or announced that they were phasing them out, including those in Seattle, San Francisco, and Chicago.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H02017AFFAB1E4BC6AA62E7E7B66A1764"><enum>(4)</enum><text>The United Kingdom phased out all circuses featuring wild animal performances by 2020 and announced its intention to ban the captivity of elephants in zoos and safari parks. Dozens of other countries around the world have similar prohibitions, including Austria, Greece, Israel, Mexico, Peru, and Singapore. India bans the keeping of elephants in circuses and zoos.</text></paragraph></subsection><subsection id="H0C192A7461984991846B1B6A19601B10"><enum>(b)</enum><header>Purpose</header><text>The purpose of this Act is to ban the display, husbandry, and breeding of African elephants and Asian elephants in zoological parks and safari parks in the United States and transfer existing African elephants and Asian elephants in zoological parks and safari parks to authorized wildlife sanctuaries.</text></subsection></section><section id="H02F9F15E3F2D41DA8F4EDB2ED72D787B"><enum>3.</enum><header>Prohibition on elephant captivity</header><text display-inline="no-display-inline">The Animal Welfare Act (<external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/7/2131">7 U.S.C. 2131 et seq.</external-xref>) is amended by adding at the end the following:</text><quoted-block style="OLC" id="HA9208DE30DB8423785F5D07BA7601425" display-inline="no-display-inline"><section id="H5E5BFEB50D1D46398AE8B3BA37E64B62"><enum>30.</enum><header>Prohibition on elephant captivity</header><subsection id="H53C4B5A165D3482B94A5F1B5E95F10F4"><enum>(a)</enum><header>In general</header><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">An exhibitor that is a safari park or zoological park may not exhibit, house, manage, or breed an African elephant or an Asian elephant after the date that is 1 year after the date of the enactment of this section, except to complete a transfer of an African elephant or an Asian elephant pursuant to subsection (b).</text></subsection><subsection id="H7557512720D14F9D9BADFFC6FA9869D7"><enum>(b)</enum><header>Transfer to authorized wildlife sanctuaries</header><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The Secretary shall require each exhibitor that is a safari park or zoological park that exhibits, houses, manages, or breeds an African elephant or an Asian elephant as of the date of the enactment of this section to transfer such African elephant or Asian elephant to an authorized wildlife sanctuary not later than 3 years after the date of the enactment of this section.</text></subsection><subsection id="H3B0CC977091E4253B3FCBE42BA5EFB3A"><enum>(c)</enum><header>Definitions</header><text>In this section:</text><paragraph id="HEFB29B3E56EC4039979BF7831822847E"><enum>(1)</enum><header>African elephant</header><text>The term <term>African elephant</term> has the meaning given the term in section 2305 of the African Elephant Conservation Act (<external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/16/4244">16 U.S.C. 4244</external-xref>).</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H631F06F4F3984840814CE0DE5D52D4B6"><enum>(2)</enum><header>Authorized wildlife sanctuary</header><text>The term <term>authorized wildlife sanctuary</term> means a nonprofit facility that—</text><subparagraph id="H069888FD4B5349F4918E45257D45269A"><enum>(A)</enum><text>is accredited by the Global Federation of Animal Sanctuaries or a similar body;</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="H14836EECECCA4CA7928A32E7B3A49DFE"><enum>(B)</enum><text>is dedicated to the lifelong care of elephants;</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="H54BFA25D5A46414EAF893BFE1CBC9F60"><enum>(C)</enum><text>does not—</text><clause id="H97749F1B9CAF4DB2AB629D480AF699BA"><enum>(i)</enum><text>breed animals;</text></clause><clause id="HE9D739BD2EF94A1985B6420421B5F706"><enum>(ii)</enum><text>exhibit animals for profit;
