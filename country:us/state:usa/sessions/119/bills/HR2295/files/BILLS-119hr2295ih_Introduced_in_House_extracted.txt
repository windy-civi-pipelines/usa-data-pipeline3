1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Weather Innovation for the Next Generation Act of 2025 or the WING Act of 2025.

Section 2:
2.Radar obstruction Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation Program(a)EstablishmentThe Director of the National Weather Service, in coordination with the Assistant Administrator for Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, shall establish a Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation Program (in this section referred to as the Program) to ensure the continued performance of weather radar detection and prediction capabilities with physical obstructions in the line of sight of such radar.(b)RequirementsIn carrying out the Program, the Director, in consultation with the Interagency Council for Advancing Meteorological Services, shall—(1)partner with industry, academia, Federal, State, and local government entities, and any other entity the Director considers appropriate;(2)identify and test existing or near-commercial technologies and solutions that mitigate the potential impact of obstructions on weather radar;(3)research additional solutions that could mitigate the effects of an obstruction on weather radar, including—(A)signal processing algorithms;(B)short-term forecasting algorithms to replace contaminated data; and(C)the use of dual polarization characteristics in mitigating the effects of wind turbines on weather radar; and(4)develop commercially viable technical mitigation solutions for obstructions to weather radar capabilities.(c)PriorityIn carrying out the requirements described in subsection (b), the Director shall prioritize consideration of the following technology-based mitigation solutions:(1)Multifunction phased array radar.(2)The replacement of contaminated data with commercial radar data.(3)The utilization of data from private-sector-associated meteorological towers.(4)Providing wind farm boundaries and consolidated wind farm areas to display on local forecasting equipment.(5)Installing and providing access to rain gauges.(6)Any other technology-based mitigation solution the Director determines could overcome beam blockage or ghost echoes.(d)TerminationThe authority of the Director to carry out the Program shall terminate on the earlier of—(1)September 30, 2030; or(2)one year after date on which the final recommendation required by subsection (e)(2) is submitted by the Director.(e)Report; recommendation(1)In generalNot later than two years after the date of the enactment of this section and annually thereafter until the Program terminates pursuant to subsection (d), the Director shall submit to Congress a report on the implementation of the Program, including an evaluation of each technology-based mitigation solution identified for priority consideration pursuant to subsection (c), and a recommendation regarding additional identification and testing of new technologies based on such consideration.(2)Final recommendationNot later than five years after the date of the enactment of this section, the Director shall provide to Congress a recommendation on whether additional research, testing, and development through the Program established under subsection (a) is needed, and a determination of whether a cessation of field research, development, testing, and evaluation is appropriate.(f)DefinitionsIn this section:(1)Beam blockageThe term beam blockage means a signal that is partially or fully blocked due to an obstruction.(2)DirectorThe term Director means the Director of the National Weather Service.(3)Ghost echoThe term ghost echo means radar signal reflectivity or velocity return errors in radar data due to the close proximity of an obstruction.(4)ObstructionThe term obstruction includes—(A)a wind turbine that could limit the effectiveness of a weather radar system; and(B)any building that disrupts or limits the effectiveness of a weather radar system.
