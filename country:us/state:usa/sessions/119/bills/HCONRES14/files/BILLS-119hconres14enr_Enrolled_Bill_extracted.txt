Section 20:
5001.Policy statement on economic growth
(a)FindingsThe House finds the following: (1)The rate of economic growth has a significant impact on budget deficits. When the rate of gross domestic product (GDP) increases, projected revenue grows with it and deficits decline. Conversely, slower GDP growth can lead to lagging revenues and mounting deficits.
(2)Federal policies affect the economy’s potential to grow and impact economic performance, influencing budgetary outcomes. Consequently, fiscally responsible policies that improve the economy’s long-term growth prospects help reduce the size of budget deficits over a given period. (3)The free market, where individuals pursue their own self-interests, has been responsible for greater advancements in quality of life and generation of wealth than any other form of economic system. Federal policies designed to grow the economy should thus allow market forces to operate unhindered rather than pick winners and losers.
(b)Policy on economic growthIn the House of Representatives, it is the policy of this concurrent resolution to pursue policies that embrace the free market and promote economic growth policies that— (1)reduce Federal spending;
(2)expand American energy production; (3)lower taxes that discourage work, savings, and investment;
(4)deregulate the economy and enact reforms to diminish bureaucratic red tape; and (5)eliminate barriers to work so more Americans enter (or reenter) the job market.

Section 21:
5002.Policy statement on mandatory spending reduction
(a)FindingsThe House finds the following: (1)The United States faces a significant debt crisis, with the national debt currently exceeding $36 trillion, or 123 percent of GDP.
(2)Since 2019, mandatory spending has increased by 59 percent. (3)This debt poses a significant risk to the country's long-term fiscal sustainability, with implications for future generations.
(4)Mandatory spending currently accounts for over 70 percent of the entire Federal budget. (5)The deficit for fiscal year 2025 is projected to be $1.9 trillion, or 6.2 percent of GDP.
(6)This fiscal year, net interest will total $952 billion, or 3.2 percent of GDP. (b)Policy on mandatory spending reductionIn the House of Representatives, the goal of this concurrent resolution is to reduce mandatory spending by $2 trillion over the budget window. If the combined deficit reduction provided by authorizing committees is below this target, it is the policy of the Committee on the Budget of the House that the instruction provided to the Committee on Ways and Means of the House should be reduced by a commensurate amount to offset the difference.

Section 22:
5003.Policy statement on Government deregulation
(a)FindingsThe House finds the following: (1)Regulations throughout the Federal Government have been a major issue for decades, continuously growing while negatively impacting the nation's economic and fiscal standing.
(2)Overregulation has consistently hurt small businesses, strangled domestic energy production, weakened labor market conditions, and expanded government overreach and costs on taxpayers. (3)Real (inflation-adjusted) spending on regulatory agencies has increased exponentially since 1960. The total number of pages in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) has increased from 22,877 pages in 1960 to nearly 200,000 today. When compared to 1950, the CFR contained only 9,745 pages in 1950, making the size of the CFR today 95% larger than it was in 1950.
(b)Policy statement on government deregulationIn this House of Representatives, it is the policy of this concurrent resolution— (1)that Congress continues to examine ways to relieve the burdens of overregulation throughout the Federal Government;
(2)that Congress is ready to promote initiatives that will reduce government bureaucracy, enhance Federalism, and increase economic prosperity through deregulation; (3)to not only reduce burdensome, costly regulations, but to also reassert the role of Congress; and
(4)to enact legislation through reconciliation that strengthens Congress, scales back Federal regulations, limits future bureaucratic red tape, and unleashes economic growth, such as the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act.

VPolicy statements in the House of Representatives
5001.Policy statement on economic growth
(a)FindingsThe House finds the following: (1)The rate of economic growth has a significant impact on budget deficits. When the rate of gross domestic product (GDP) increases, projected revenue grows with it and deficits decline. Conversely, slower GDP growth can lead to lagging revenues and mounting deficits.
(2)Federal policies affect the economy’s potential to grow and impact economic performance, influencing budgetary outcomes. Consequently, fiscally responsible policies that improve the economy’s long-term growth prospects help reduce the size of budget deficits over a given period. (3)The free market, where individuals pursue their own self-interests, has been responsible for greater advancements in quality of life and generation of wealth than any other form of economic system. Federal policies designed to grow the economy should thus allow market forces to operate unhindered rather than pick winners and losers.
(b)Policy on economic growthIn the House of Representatives, it is the policy of this concurrent resolution to pursue policies that embrace the free market and promote economic growth policies that— (1)reduce Federal spending;
(2)expand American energy production; (3)lower taxes that discourage work, savings, and investment;
(4)deregulate the economy and enact reforms to diminish bureaucratic red tape; and (5)eliminate barriers to work so more Americans enter (or reenter) the job market.
5002.Policy statement on mandatory spending reduction
(a)FindingsThe House finds the following: (1)The United States faces a significant debt crisis, with the national debt currently exceeding $36 trillion, or 123 percent of GDP.
(2)Since 2019, mandatory spending has increased by 59 percent. (3)This debt poses a significant risk to the country's long-term fiscal sustainability, with implications for future generations.
(4)Mandatory spending currently accounts for over 70 percent of the entire Federal budget. (5)The deficit for fiscal year 2025 is projected to be $1.9 trillion, or 6.2 percent of GDP.
(6)This fiscal year, net interest will total $952 billion, or 3.2 percent of GDP. (b)Policy on mandatory spending reductionIn the House of Representatives, the goal of this concurrent resolution is to reduce mandatory spending by $2 trillion over the budget window. If the combined deficit reduction provided by authorizing committees is below this target, it is the policy of the Committee on the Budget of the House that the instruction provided to the Committee on Ways and Means of the House should be reduced by a commensurate amount to offset the difference.
5003.Policy statement on Government deregulation
(a)FindingsThe House finds the following: (1)Regulations throughout the Federal Government have been a major issue for decades, continuously growing while negatively impacting the nation's economic and fiscal standing.
(2)Overregulation has consistently hurt small businesses, strangled domestic energy production, weakened labor market conditions, and expanded government overreach and costs on taxpayers. (3)Real (inflation-adjusted) spending on regulatory agencies has increased exponentially since 1960. The total number of pages in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) has increased from 22,877 pages in 1960 to nearly 200,000 today. When compared to 1950, the CFR contained only 9,745 pages in 1950, making the size of the CFR today 95% larger than it was in 1950.
(b)Policy statement on government deregulationIn this House of Representatives, it is the policy of this concurrent resolution— (1)that Congress continues to examine ways to relieve the burdens of overregulation throughout the Federal Government;
(2)that Congress is ready to promote initiatives that will reduce government bureaucracy, enhance Federalism, and increase economic prosperity through deregulation; (3)to not only reduce burdensome, costly regulations, but to also reassert the role of Congress; and
(4)to enact legislation through reconciliation that strengthens Congress, scales back Federal regulations, limits future bureaucratic red tape, and unleashes economic growth, such as the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act.
