Although investments in linguists were made since World War Two to support American military and foreign policy, the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, exposed a shortage of members of the Armed Forces who speak highly valuable languages. The terrorist attacks highlighted the persistent and continuous need for the Department of Defense to maintain a designated cohort of qualified linguists to respond to crises or contingencies anywhere in the world. In response, the Defense Language Institute Foreign Language Center (DLIFLC) was created. Today, DLIFLC remains the premier school of the Department of Defense for culturally based foreign language education and training.</text></paragraph>
