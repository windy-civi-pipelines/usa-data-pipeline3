IV119th CONGRESS1st SessionH. RES. 560IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESJune 27, 2025Mr. Strong (for himself, Mr. Moore of Alabama, Mr. Figures, Mr. Rogers of Alabama, Mr. Aderholt, Mr. Palmer, and Ms. Sewell) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Science, Space, and TechnologyRESOLUTIONCommemorating the 65th anniversary of the Marshall Space Flight Center and recognizing its continued leadership in the development of the Space Launch System and human space exploration. 
Whereas the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), located in Huntsville, Alabama, was officially established on July 1, 1960, as one of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) premier centers for spaceflight research and development;  Whereas MSFC played a pivotal role in the historic Apollo program, designing and developing the Saturn V rocket that carried astronauts to the Moon and marked a defining achievement in American scientific and engineering excellence;
         
Whereas MSFC has consistently led innovation and mission support for critical NASA programs, including Skylab, America’s first space station, the Hubble Space Telescope, Chandra X-ray Observatory, and numerous other scientific payloads that have revolutionized understanding of the universe; Whereas MSFC has provided engineering leadership, payload integration, and science operations in support of the International Space Station (ISS), helping maintain a continuous human presence in space since the year 2000; 

 Whereas MSFC continues to serve as the lead center for the development and integration of the Space Launch System (SLS), NASA’s most powerful launch vehicle since Saturn V, and a cornerstone of the Artemis program;
         
Whereas the SLS represents the Nation’s commitment to returning humans to the Moon, preparing for future crewed missions to Mars, and expanding deep space exploration for generations to come; Whereas MSFC’s leadership in the SLS program exemplifies the Center’s unmatched technical expertise in large-scale propulsion systems, systems integration, and complex spaceflight engineering; 
Whereas the Center continues to serve as an anchor for the aerospace industry and STEM education in the Tennessee Valley region and beyond, providing high-tech jobs, economic opportunity, and outreach to schools and universities; and Whereas the Marshall Space Flight Center is home to a dedicated workforce committed to excellence, safety, integrity, and teamwork: Now, therefore, be it 
That the House of Representatives— (1)commemorates the 65th anniversary of the establishment of the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC); 
(2)recognizes the historical legacy and critical contributions of MSFC to the United States leadership in space exploration over the past six and a half decades; (3)commends the Marshall Space Flight Center’s continued excellence and leadership in the development and integration of the Space Launch System (SLS) as the leading technology for deep space exploration; 

                (4)
