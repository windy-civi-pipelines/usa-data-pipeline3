3.FindingsCongress finds the following: (1)The India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC), launched at the G20 Summit in 2023 with G7 backing, enhances connectivity between Asia, the Middle East, and Europe while serving as a strategic alternative to China’s Belt and Road Initiative.

(3)Energy projects such as the Great Sea Interconnector, the Gregy Interconnection Project, the Greece-Bulgaria Interconnector, and the LNG terminals in the Eastern Mediterranean play a key role in European energy security and provide critical infrastructure that can serve as the backbone for linking India, the Gulf, and Europe through the Eastern Mediterranean. 
(4)Cyprus, Greece, Egypt, and Israel are key United States partners in promoting stability, security, and economic development in the region.

(6)According to Presidential Determination 2025–03, the furnishing of defense articles and defense services to the Republic of Cyprus will strengthen the security of the United States and promote world peace. (7)The statement of policy in the Israel Relations Normalization Act of 2022 (22 U.S.C. 8601 note), notably that it is the policy of the United States to expand and strengthen the Abraham Accords to encourage other nations to normalize relations with Israel, should guide the Secretary of State and other United States actors in their work to promote integration between India, the Middle East and southeast Europe. 

        (8)
 India has strengthened strategic ties with Greece, Israel, and Cyprus, fostering economic, maritime, and security cooperation that aligns with United States regional priorities.

(4)the United States recognizes the unique role of Eastern Mediterranean countries as both a distinct subregion and a central connector within the broader IMEC corridor;  (5) the 3+1 diplomatic initiative should resume with a meeting of the Secretary of State with the Ministers of Israel, Greece, and Cyprus; and
      
(6)the statement of policy in section 203 of the Eastern Mediterranean Security and Energy Partnership Act of 2019 (22 U.S.C. 2373 note) should guide the Secretary of State in promoting connectivity between India, the Middle East and Europe, including participation in the trilateral dialogue on energy, maritime security, cyber security and protection of critical infrastructure conducted among Israel, Greece, and Cyprus.
