Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Creating Resources for Every American To Experiment with Artificial Intelligence Act of 2025 or the CREATE AI Act of 2025.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following:(1)Cutting-edge artificial intelligence research relies on access to computational resources and large datasets. (2)Access to the computational resources and datasets necessary for artificial intelligence research and development is often limited to very large technology companies.(3)The lack of access to computational and data resources has resulted in insufficient diversity in the artificial intelligence research and development community. (4)Engaging the full and diverse talent of the United States is critical for maintaining United States leadership in artificial intelligence and ensuring that artificial intelligence is developed in a manner that benefits all people of the United States. (5)The National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource Task Force, authorized under section 5106 of the National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Act of 2020 (15 U.S.C. 9401 et seq.), recommended the establishment of a National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource in a report entitled Strengthening and Democratizing the U.S. Artificial Intelligence Innovation Ecosystem: An Implementation Plan for a National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource, issued on January 24, 2023.
