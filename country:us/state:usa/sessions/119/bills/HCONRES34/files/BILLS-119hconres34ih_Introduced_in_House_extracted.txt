IV119th CONGRESS1st SessionH. CON. RES. 34IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESMay 29, 2025Ms. Stansbury submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign AffairsCONCURRENT RESOLUTIONExpressing the need for the Senate to provide advice and consent to ratification of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity.Whereas human actions are contributing to an unprecedented and increasing loss of biodiversity worldwide;Whereas nearly 1,000,000 species could be threatened with extinction;Whereas every United Nations member state has ratified the Convention on Biological Diversity, done at Rio de Janeiro June 5, 1992, with the exception of the United States;Whereas the United States signed the Convention on Biological Diversity in 1993 but has not ratified the treaty;Whereas the United States, under current domestic law, is already legally compliant with the obligations of the Convention;Whereas Federal agencies often design their plans to align with Convention on Biological Diversity initiatives;Whereas the absence of the United States from the Convention on Biological Diversity limits the United States to holding the status of an observer to deliberations and decision making processes of the Convention on Biodiversity;Whereas, not being party to the Convention on Biological Diversity, the United States does not have a vote within the convention, which diminishes our voice and influence;Whereas the decisions and rules made by the Convention on Biological Diversity affect both national security and economic interests of the United States in spite of the United States non-party status;Whereas the United States has historically been one of the worldâ€™s largest contributors to international conservation efforts and a global leader in biodiversity science and expertise, though recent shifts in Federal policy and funding have weakened that leadership role; andWhereas we are inextricably interconnected on this planet, and the work of the Convention on Biological Diversity has a direct impact on all Americans: Now, therefore, be itThat it is in the national interest for the Senate to provide its advice and consent for the ratification of the Convention on Biological Diversity, which was signed by the United States in New York on June 4, 1993.
