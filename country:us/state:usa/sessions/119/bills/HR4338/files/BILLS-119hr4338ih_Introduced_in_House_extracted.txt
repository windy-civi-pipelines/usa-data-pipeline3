Section 2:
2.Establishment of Weather-Safe Energy Platform and support for electricity system planning and operational modeling(a)Initial report on meteorological and extreme weather event dataNot later than 6 months after the date of the enactment of this section, the Secretary shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report containing the following:(1)A summary of current efforts in federally funded research and development centers to develop the use of meteorological, hydrological, and extreme weather event data for energy system modeling.(2)A description of the specific actions that the Secretary shall take to carry out subsection (b).(b)Weather-Safe Energy Platform digital tool(1)In generalThe Secretary shall develop and maintain an open-access digital tool, to be known as the Weather-Safe Energy Platform (in this section, referred to as the Platform), to provide high-resolution data of meteorological and hydrological variables suitable for electricity system planning and operational models.(2)Availability of PlatformThe Secretary shall make available the Platform not later than 2 years after the date of the enactment of this section.(3)Contents of PlatformThe Platform shall include the following, with respect to the United States:(A)Meteorological and hydrological variables derived from state-of-the-science atmospheric models used in international model intercomparison projects, regional forecasting datasets, and reanalysis data, as determined appropriate by the Secretary, at spatiotemporal resolutions suitable for electricity system planning and operational modeling.(B)Information that maintains spatiotemporal correlation of the meteorological and hydrological variables to ensure a realistic and reliable representation of conditions that may contribute to cascading failures of electricity systems.(C)Historical data and projections of meteorological and hydrological variables across short-, medium-, and long-term timelines, developed using methods that ensure consistency with standard practices for evaluating electricity system planning and operational decisions.(D)Sufficient information to provide for ensemble model scenarios that support narrative- or storytelling-based approaches to modeling current and future conditions and effects on electricity systems.(E)Up-to-date information provided by ongoing relevant research projects.(4)Stakeholder inputThe Secretary shall include input from stakeholders determined appropriate by the Secretary, including utility companies, municipalities, independent system operators,
