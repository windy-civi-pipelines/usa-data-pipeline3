Every day, stories surface of schools shortening their weeks, canceling courses, increasing student-teacher ratios, and placing underprepared or temporary substitute staff in core instructional roles. Such adjustments disrupt learning, take a sustained toll on teacher morale, and harm student achievement. </text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HFC2AF5D2DEC246F186F49857C8554809"><enum>(3)</enum><text>The teacher wage penalty, characterizing lower weekly wages and overall compensation for teachers compared to college-educated peers in other professions, hit an all-time high of 23.5 percent in 2021 and continues to demonstrate significant, adverse impacts on teacher recruitment and retention. According to a recent report by the Teacher Salary Project, over 90 percent of teachers believe low salary contributes to shortages in their communities and over 45 percent believe their salary is insufficient for medium and long-term career sustainability.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H427E76B1E92945BC9E20D1EBBED23A6A"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Significant numbers of teachers report maintaining multiple jobs to make ends meet or being able to work in their profession only through the support of a partnerâ€™s higher-paying job. This instability is worse for teachers of color who are more likely to work in under-resourced schools. As a result, high-poverty communities face a compounded burden.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H8F1813D6F0DE450A842B723E2703F9BC"><enum>(5)</enum><text>In August of 2022, the White House issued a fact sheet renewing attention to the weak teacher pipeline and calling upon legislators to use federal, state, and local resources to strengthen teaching career pathways and ensure competitive, livable wages. This statement accompanies efforts by twenty-five states to propose and enact legislation addressing teacher compensation since January 2021.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H8B0C2D406E584923849C68CAFE6CF8C3"><enum>(6)</enum><text>To restore stability in our schools and secure equitable access to high-quality education, we must raise awareness surrounding the value of teaching as a profession and provide compensation that reflects this value.</text></paragraph></section>
