Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the EITC Modernization Act.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following:
(1)The Federal earned income tax credit is a refundable tax credit for lower- and middle-income working individuals and families whose earnings are below an income threshold. (2)Since its establishment in 1975, the credit has increased family income, reduced child poverty, and promoted employment by supplementing the earnings of low-wage workers, including military families.
(3)The credit has a positive impact on the education and health of children living in poverty. (4)The credit has a positive economic impact on local economies and businesses because it puts more money in the hands of low- and middle-income working people who spend the money on immediate needs, such as groceries, school supplies, car repairs, rent, and health care.
(5)The widening gap between the incomes of the wealthiest Americans and those of middle- and lower-income Americans is alarming. (6)There is an urgent need to address that gap, including through measures like this legislation and by raising the Federal minimum wage which together increase the wages of working Americans, widen the path to income stability, and narrow income inequality.
