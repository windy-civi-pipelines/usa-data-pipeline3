Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the New World Screwworm Preparedness Act of 2025.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following: 
(1)The New World screwworm (Cochliomyia hominivorax) (in this section referred to as NWS) is a parasitic fly whose larvae infest and feed on the living tissue of warm-blooded animals, including livestock, wildlife, and, in rare cases, humans. (2)NWS infestations can lead to severe damage, secondary infections, and often death in affected animals, posing a significant threat to agricultural economies, wildlife populations, and public health. 
(3)The United States successfully eradicated NWS in the 1960s through significant efforts, primarily utilizing the sterile insect technique, which involves releasing sterile male flies to disrupt reproduction in wild populations. (4)Recent outbreaks and confirmed detections of NWS in neighboring countries, particularly Mexico, indicate an increasing risk of reintroduction and establishment of NWS within the United States. 
(5)Proactive measures, including enhanced surveillance, rapid response capabilities, and continued research into innovative control methods, are critical to preventing a widespread NWS outbreak and mitigating its potential economic and ecological impact.

Section 3:
3.Study and report on New World screwworm preparedness (a)In generalNot later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Agriculture, acting through the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (in this section referred to as the Secretary) shall conduct a comprehensive study on the current State of United States preparedness and response capabilities to combat the New World screwworm (in this section referred to as NWS). 
(b)Components of the studyThe study under this section shall include the following: (1)Current threat assessmentAn analysis of the current threat posed by NWS to the United States, including— 
(A)the migratory patterns and confirmed detections of NWS in countries bordering the United States; (B)the potential pathways for NWS introduction into the United States; 
(C)the economic impact of a potential NWS outbreak on the United States livestock industry, including cattle, swine, and other susceptible animals; and (D)the ecological impact of a potential NWS outbreak on domestic wildlife populations. 
(2)Sterile insect technique capabilitiesA review of the United States capacity to produce and deploy sterile NWS flies, including— (A)the current status and capacity of existing NWS sterile fly production facilities; 
(B)the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of establishing new or expanding existing modular NWS sterile fly rearing facilities within the United States, including potential locations based on risk assessment; and (C)the logistical requirements for effective dispersal of sterile flies in areas at risk of infestation. 
(3)Surveillance and detection systemsAn evaluation of current NWS surveillance and detection systems, including— (A)the effectiveness of border inspection protocols for live animals; 
(B)the adequacy of diagnostic capabilities and laboratory infrastructure; and (C)the integration of public and private sector reporting mechanisms for suspected NWS cases. 
(4)Emergency response plansAn examination of existing emergency response plans for NWS outbreaks, including— (A)the coordination mechanisms between Federal, State, and local agencies; 
(B)the availability of resources for rapid containment and eradication efforts; and (C)protocols for animal movement restrictions and public outreach during an outbreak. 
(5)Research and development needsIdentification of critical research and development needs to enhance NWS prevention, control, and eradication, including— (A)new diagnostic tools; 
(B)improved sterile insect techniques; (C)alternative control methods; and 
(D)genetic research into NWS vulnerabilities. (6)International cooperationAn assessment of the effectiveness of current international co-operation efforts with affected countries and recommendations for strengthening such partnerships to establish and maintain biological barriers. 
(c)Stakeholder consultationIn conducting the study under this section, the Secretary shall consult with relevant stakeholders, including— (1)livestock producers and industry associations; 
(2)wildlife management agencies; (3)veterinary professionals; 
(4)scientific experts in entomology, epidemiology, and animal health; and (5)State and local agricultural and public health officials. 
(d)Report to CongressNot later than 6 months after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate, and make publicly available, a report— (1)detailing the findings of the study under this section; and 
(2)providing recommendations for legislative and administrative actions to improve the United States' ability to combat NWS.
