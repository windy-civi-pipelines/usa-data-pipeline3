Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following:(1)A growing body of evidence demonstrates that firearm dealers’ sales practices affect the probability of firearms getting to criminals and that policies designed to hold firearm sellers accountable can curtail the diversion of firearms to criminals.(2)Federal laws governing firearm dealers—(A)have not been updated in more than 30 years;(B)contain safeguards that protect dealers who engage in illegal practices from adverse enforcement action;(C)frustrate law enforcement efforts to curb firearm trafficking and violence; and(D)are, thus, inadequate to meet the realities of the 21st century.(3)(A)The Tiahrt Amendments, for one—(i)severely limit the authority of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (commonly known as the ATF) to disclose crime firearm trace data to the public;(ii)prevent—(I)the collection of valuable information; and(II)the establishment of effective policies to prevent illegal firearms from being used in crimes; and(iii)impede enforcement of the firearm laws by—(I)requiring most background check records to be destroyed within 24 hours; and(II)barring the Government from requiring owners of firearm shops to conduct annual inventory audits.(B)Repealing the Tiahrt Amendments would support law enforcement efforts and give the public vital information needed to craft the most effective policies against illegal firearms.(4)Additionally, Federal law imposes no requirements that firearm dealers physically secure their highly valuable and lethal inventory. The number of firearm thefts from licensed firearm dealers has increased more than the number from any other source. Between 2013 and 2017, the number of firearms stolen in firearm-dealer burglaries more than doubled and the number of firearms stolen in firearm-dealer robberies tripled.

(C)For purposes of this paragraph, the term variant means a weapon utilizing a similar frame or receiver design irrespective of new or different model designations or configurations, characteristics, features, components, accessories, or attachments.

Deadline for issuance of final regulations.2.FindingsCongress finds the following:(1)A growing body of evidence demonstrates that firearm dealers’ sales practices affect the probability of firearms getting to criminals and that policies designed to hold firearm sellers accountable can curtail the diversion of firearms to criminals.(2)Federal laws governing firearm dealers—(A)have not been updated in more than 30 years;(B)contain safeguards that protect dealers who engage in illegal practices from adverse enforcement action;(C)frustrate law enforcement efforts to curb firearm trafficking and violence; and(D)are, thus, inadequate to meet the realities of the 21st century.(3)(A)The Tiahrt Amendments, for one—(i)severely limit the authority of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (commonly known as the ATF) to disclose crime firearm trace data to the public;(ii)prevent—(I)the collection of valuable information; and(II)the establishment of effective policies to prevent illegal firearms from being used in crimes; and(iii)impede enforcement of the firearm laws by—(I)requiring most background check records to be destroyed within 24 hours; and(II)barring the Government from requiring owners of firearm shops to conduct annual inventory audits.(B)Repealing the Tiahrt Amendments would support law enforcement efforts and give the public vital information needed to craft the most effective policies against illegal firearms.(4)Additionally, Federal law imposes no requirements that firearm dealers physically secure their highly valuable and lethal inventory. The number of firearm thefts from licensed firearm dealers has increased more than the number from any other source. Between 2013 and 2017, the number of firearms stolen in firearm-dealer burglaries more than doubled and the number of firearms stolen in firearm-dealer robberies tripled.3.DefinitionsSection 921(a) of title 18, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:(38)The term facilitator means any person engaged in the business of hosting a commercial marketplace in which offers for firearm sales, purchases, or other transfers are allowed to be made, except that such a person shall not be considered to be a facilitator with respect to any transaction that is made through the use of a website or mobile application owned or operated by the person if—(A)the transaction violates the terms of service of the website or mobile application; and(B)the person has made a good faith effort to enforce the terms of service by, at a minimum, auditing firearms transactions on a quarterly basis to ensure compliance with this chapter.(39)The term occasional means, with respect to transactions, fewer than 5 transactions in a 12-month period.(40)The term personal collection includes any firearm obtained only for the personal use of an individual and not for the purpose of selling or trading, except that a firearm obtained through inheritance shall not be considered part of a personal collection until the firearm has been possessed for 1 year.(41)The term business inventory firearm means, with respect to a person, a firearm required by law to be recorded in the acquisition and disposition logs of any firearms business of the person.(42)(A)The term frame means the part of a handgun, or a variant thereof, that provides housing or a structure for the primary energized component designed to hold back the hammer, striker, bolt, or similar component prior to initiation of the firing sequence (such as a sear or the equivalent), even if pins or other attachments are required to connect such component to the housing or structure.(B)The term receiver means the part of a rifle, shotgun, or projectile weapon other than a handgun, or a variant thereof, that provides housing or a structure for the primary component designed to block or seal the breech prior to initiation of the firing sequence (such as a bolt, breechblock, or the equivalent), even if pins or other attachments are required to connect such component to the housing or structure.
