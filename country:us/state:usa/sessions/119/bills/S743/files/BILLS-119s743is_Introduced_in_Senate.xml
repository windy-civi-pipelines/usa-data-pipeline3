For example, the use by the Government of India of unrestrained price support programs violates the commitments by that government under the World Trade Organization.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="id11b9709413764b309f9cb5c248de24e3"><enum>(7)</enum><text>The Government of India recognizes that its price support programs violate its commitments under the World Trade Organization, so instead of reforming its programs, it has repeatedly demanded an exemption from disputes for those programs. Moreover, the Government of India has tried to prevent discussions at the World Trade Organization of any other significant agricultural trade issue unless it gets a permanent exemption from disputes for those programs.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="id222a275440aa4871a1af93e09fb12b8c"><enum>(8)</enum><text>The Government of India has repeatedly raised its minimum price supports, which has had negative effects on several commodity markets and most notably has led to its dominance of the global rice trade, with a 40-percent share of the global market since marketing year 2020 through 2021. India is also the world's largest producer of pulses and second largest producer of wheat, peanuts, and cotton.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="id9651396da1484e05bc2b772138b0eecf"><enum>(9)</enum><text>The United States Trade Representative submitted a counter notification at the World Trade Organization in 2023 showing that price supports by the Government of India for rice increased from 78.6 percent of the value of production in marketing year 2014 through 2015 to 93.9 percent of the value of production in marketing year 2020 through 2021, compared to the limit at the World Trade Organization on increased price supports of 10 percent of the value of production. That counter notification also showed price supports by the Government of India for wheat increasing from 77.7 percent to 81.3 percent during the same period. Previous counter notifications have shown similar violations by the Government of India for other commodities. For example, in the marketing year 2016 through 2017, price supports by the Government of Indian were 67.9 percent for cotton, 31.7 percent for chickpeas, 41 percent for lentils, and 47.4 percent for pulses overall.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="id40ae71990d1f4a1f84335414eae0c017"><enum>(10)</enum><text>Minor attempts to reform the agriculture subsidy system in India in marketing year 2020 through 2021 failed to produce results. Reforms enacted as a result of those attempts would not have changed the policies that violate commitments under the World Trade Organization, but would have merely provided farmers in India with opportunities to sell their products outside of the government-run mandi system, but those reforms were ultimately repealed.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="idb633ab9224914438bce4c7c600644f27"><enum>(11)</enum><text>Dispute settlement is an effective way to provide a neutral assessment of compliance with terms of trade agreements and empower internal reformers who recognize a problem but have not been able to overcome entrenched resistance.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="id3cadf2f9cec8430e9691e0a2a668fef6"><enum>(12)</enum><text>Global agriculture is uniquely susceptible to trade barriers and requires special attention to resolve myriad systemic and economically significant trade violations that impede the development of a resilient, sustainable, and rules-based agricultural trading system.</text></paragraph></section><section id="idf8e72a09b8b74c95a336d7ad1c3470ff"><enum>3.</enum><header>Sense of Congress</header><text
