Council to enforce the existing arms embargo on Darfur and extend it to cover all of Sudan.</official-title></form><preamble><whereas><text>Whereas the conflict between the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (Hemedti), and the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, that began on April 15, 2023, has resulted in tens of thousands of Sudanese civilian casualties, and likely more, 12,500,000 million people forcibly displaced, and millions of Sudanese people exposed to unspeakable trauma;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the violence and genocide taking place in Sudan against civilians echoes the horrors of the genocide in the country’s Darfur region that began in the early 2000s;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, in July 2004, the United Nations Security Council adopted resolution United Nations Security Council Resolution 1556 (2004), which imposed an arms embargo against all non-governmental entities and individuals, including the Janjaweed, operating in Darfur, and mandated that all states shall take the necessary measures to prevent their nationals or entities operating from their respective territories or using their flag vessels or aircraft, from supplying non-governmental entities or individuals operating in Darfur arms and related materiel of all types, including weapons and ammunition, military vehicles and equipment, paramilitary equipment, and spare parts;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, in March 2005, the United Nations Security Council arms embargo under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1591 (2005) was expanded to include all belligerents in Darfur, including the Government of Sudan;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, in October 2010, United Nations Security Council Resolution 1945 (2010) was adopted, which strengthened the arms embargo by deciding that all states shall ensure that any sale or supply of arms and related materiel to Sudan not prohibited by United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1556 (2004) and 1591 (2005) are made conditional upon the necessary end user documentation so that states may ascertain that any such sale or supply is conducted consistent with the measures imposed by those resolutions;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, on September 11, 2024, the United Nations Security Council renewed United Nations Security Council Resolution 1556 (2004);</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas state actors and non-state actors across the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and Europe are providing weapons and material support to the RSF and SAF for operations in Darfur and across Sudan;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas a September 9, 2024, report from Human Rights Watch noted that according to the Arms Trade Database, maintained by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), weapons and equipment from other countries have arrived in Sudan between 2004 and 2023;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, on January 15, 2024, the United Nations Panel of Experts on Sudan presented credible reports to the United Nations Security Council of newly established supply lines to the RSF through neighboring countries;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas there are credible reports that multiple countries are supplying weapons and other dual-use items to the SAF;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas a 2024 report by the Department of State-affiliated Conflict Observatory describes regular cargo plane deliveries of weapons from foreign nations to the RSF in Darfur via Amdjarass, Chad, and to the SAF via Port Sudan, Sudan;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas two 2024 reports by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch identified defense articles in Sudan, including 8 kinds of small arms manufactured in 6 different foreign countries, 6 kinds of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) manufactured in 8 different foreign countries, 5 kinds of ordnances and projectiles manufactured in 6 different foreign countries, and several other types of materiel related to weapons manufactured in 7 different foreign countries, which increase the lethality of the conflict;</text></whereas><whereas commented="no"><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Whereas these weapons have been observed both inside and outside Darfur, including Gedaref, Northern and Southern Kordofan, Khartoum, and El Gezira state, all areas that are under either SAF or RSF control and where the fact-finding mission documented atrocities, child recruitment, heavy shelling, or sexual violence;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas a January 16, 2025, Yale Humanitarian Lab report observed the proliferation of cargo flights to RSF-controlled airports, followed by extensive satellite sightings of advanced UAV systems used for lethal attacks and surveillance;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the conflict has led to the partial or complete destruction of cities across Sudan, including El Geneina, El Fasher, El Obeid, Kadugli, Nyala, Wad al-Noura, Zalingei, and even the capital Khartoum;</text></whereas><whereas commented="no"><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Whereas one or both parties to the conflict have participated in mass atrocities in all of these cities;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, on February 12, 2025, the RSF attacked the camp for internally displaced persons in Zamzam, Darfur, dropping aerial munitions, firing upon crowds, killing humanitarian workers, setting fires, committing atrocities against camp residents, and driving some to flee on foot;</text></whereas><whereas commented="no"><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Whereas the provision of armaments to the RSF and SAF prolongs this conflict and the needless suffering among civilians in Sudan;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas both the RSF and SAF have continued to use internet shutdowns as a tool of control and repression, further isolating and exacerbating the suffering of civilians and the ongoing humanitarian crisis;</text></whereas><whereas commented="no"><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Whereas, on December 6, 2023, Secretary of State Anthony Blinken determined that the SAF and the RSF have committed war crimes and that the RSF and its allies have committed crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, on January 7, 2025, the Secretary of State determined that the RSF is committing genocide;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, in January 2025, the Department of Treasury sanctioned Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (Hemedti) and Abdel Fattah al-Burhan for <quote>destabilizing Sudan and undermining the goal of a democratic transition</quote>;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, in September 2024, the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission for the Sudan, authorized by the United Nations Human Rights Council, reported that it had found reasonable grounds to believe that both the SAF and the RSF have committed war crimes and the RSF and allied militias have committed crimes against humanity;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the fact-finding mission has documented the use of explosives with wide area effects in densely populated areas, particularly in Khartoum and Darfur, that has resulted in deaths, injuries, extensive destruction of homes, hospitals, schools and other critical infrastructure, and the fact-finding mission has found that the SAF and the RSF have failed to take sufficient measures to minimize the impact of attacks on civilians;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the supply and provision of weapons to parties involved in crimes against humanity and other atrocities could implicate state and non-state actors supplying weapons used in such atrocities;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, while no reliable fatality figures exist, according to the United States Special Envoy for Sudan, as many as 150,000 people may have died in the first year of the war, and according to advanced statistical estimates from researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, at least 60,000 people have died in Khartoum state alone;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, a Cholera outbreak declared in August 2024 has garnered more than 550,000 cases and over 1,500 deaths across multiple states in Sudan;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas women and children have been subjected to torture and extreme sexual violence in Darfur, Northern and Southern Kordofan, Khartoum, and El Gezira states;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, in March 2025, UNICEF reports indicated more than 220 cases of child rape since the start of 2024;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the fact-finding mission reports that children are being forcibly recruited, trained, and armed by the SAF in Khartoum, River Nile, Kassala, Gedaref, Sennar, and Red Sea states, and by the RSF in the Darfur, Kordofan, and Khartoum states;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the draft resolution contained in document S/2024/826, submitted to the United Nations Security Council on November 18, 2024, by Sierra Leone and the United Kingdom, and calling for a nationwide ceasefire, increased protection of civilians and the unhindered flow of humanitarian aid across Sudan and garnered support from 14 out of 15 United Nations Security Council members;</text></whereas><whereas commented="no"><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Whereas only one individual has ever been sanctioned for violating the Darfur arms embargo pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1591 (2005); and</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the fact-finding mission has recommended that the United Nations arms embargo be expanded to cover the entire country: Now, therefore, be it </text></whereas></preamble><resolution-body><section id="S1" display-inline="yes-display-inline" section-type="undesignated-section"><text>That the Senate—</text><paragraph
