Such report shall include the recommendations of the Secretary with respect to such results and a timeline for carrying out any such recommendations. (c)DefinitionsIn this section: 
(1)The term air-to-air collision detection system— (A)means an airborne system designed to detect and warn pilots of potential mid-air collisions with other aircraft equipped with transponders, allowing them to take evasive maneuvers to avoid a crash; and 
(B)is compatible with the system used by commercial aircraft that is commonly referred to as a traffic alert and collision avoidance system of a TCAS. (2)The term air-to-ground collision detection system means a system that uses radar, digital terrain maps, and other sensors to warn pilots of potential collisions, and if a collision is likely, to notify the pilot through a series of alarms or to automatically take control of the aircraft to avoid the collision. 
(3)The term appropriate committees of Congress means the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives. (4)The term commercial service airport has the meaning given the term in section 47102 of title 49, United States Code.  
(5)The term operate in highly trafficked domestic airspaces means, with respect to aircraft of the Department of Defense, that such aircraft are stationed on or near, and operate regular flight patterns within the surrounding class B, C, or D airspace of a commercial service airport.
