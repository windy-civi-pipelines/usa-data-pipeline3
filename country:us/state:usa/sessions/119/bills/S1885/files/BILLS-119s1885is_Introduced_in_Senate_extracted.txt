Section 1:
1.
            Short title
 This Act may be cited as the Stop the Scroll Act.

Section 2:
2.
            Findings
 Congress finds the following:  (1) Social media platform use is associated with risks to the physical and mental health of users, including exposure to bullying, online harassment and abuse, discrimination, and child sexual exploitation.
            
            
                (2)
 Product warning labels can increase awareness of risks and influence behavior.
            
            
                (3)
 Extended use of social media, which addictive algorithms encourage, can contribute to negative health impacts associated with covered platforms.
            
            
                (4)
 The Federal Government has a compelling interest in ensuring that users of a covered platform can make informed decisions about the amount of time the user spends on the covered platform, which requires an understanding of the mental health risks involved with using a covered platform.
            
            
                (5)
 In May 2023, the Surgeon General issued an advisory warning that social media use is associated with a broad range of harms to mental health, and then called for warning labels on covered platforms to raise awareness of these risks and promote healthier online engagement.
            
            
                (6)
 Given the substantial body of evidence documenting the adverse health effects of unregulated digital engagement, it is both appropriate and necessary to require clear, factual risk disclosures to ensure users are adequately informed before engaging with such platforms.
            
            
                (7)
 This approach aligns with well-established public health standards that have long governed disclosure practices in industries affecting consumer well-being.
            
            
                (8)
 Conspicuousness of labels is important, as evidenced by studies on tobacco and alcohol warning labels.

                    (3)

 provide the user access to Federal resources to address the potential negative mental health impacts described in paragraph (1), including the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline.
                
            
            
                (c)
                Restrictions on form
 A covered platform provider may not—  (1) include a covered label exclusively through a hyperlink or in the terms and conditions of the covered platform;
                
                
                    (2)
 include extraneous information in a covered label that obscures the visibility or prominence of the covered label; or

        II
        119th CONGRESS
        1st Session
        S. 1885
        IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
        
            May 22, 2025
            Mrs. Britt (for herself and Mr. Fetterman) introduced the following bill; which
                was read twice and referred to the Committee
                    on Commerce, Science, and Transportation
        
        A BILL
        To require the Federal Trade Commission, with the concurrence of the
            Secretary of Health and Human Services acting through the Surgeon General, to implement
            a mental health warning label on covered platforms, and for other purposes.
        
    
    
        
            1.
            Short title
 This Act may be cited as the Stop the Scroll Act.
        
        
            2.
            Findings
 Congress finds the following:  (1) Social media platform use is associated with risks to the physical and mental health of users, including exposure to bullying, online harassment and abuse, discrimination, and child sexual exploitation.
            
            
                (2)
 Product warning labels can increase awareness of risks and influence behavior.
            
            
                (3)
 Extended use of social media, which addictive algorithms encourage, can contribute to negative health impacts associated with covered platforms.
            
            
                (4)
 The Federal Government has a compelling interest in ensuring that users of a covered platform can make informed decisions about the amount of time the user spends on the covered platform, which requires an understanding of the mental health risks involved with using a covered platform.
            
            
                (5)
 In May 2023, the Surgeon General issued an advisory warning that social media use is associated with a broad range of harms to mental health, and then called for warning labels on covered platforms to raise awareness of these risks and promote healthier online engagement.
            
            
                (6)
 Given the substantial body of evidence documenting the adverse health effects of unregulated digital engagement, it is both appropriate and necessary to require clear, factual risk disclosures to ensure users are adequately informed before engaging with such platforms.
            
            
                (7)
 This approach aligns with well-established public health standards that have long governed disclosure practices in industries affecting consumer well-being.
            
            
                (8)
 Conspicuousness of labels is important, as evidenced by studies on tobacco and alcohol warning labels.
            
        
        
            3.

                (2)
