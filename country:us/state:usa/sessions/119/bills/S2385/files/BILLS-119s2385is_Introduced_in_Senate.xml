This revisionist movement seeks to undermine the remarkable achievements of the United States by casting its founding principles and historical milestones in a negative light. Under this historical revision, our Nation's unparalleled legacy of advancing liberty, individual rights, and human happiness is reconstructed as inherently racist, sexist, oppressive, or otherwise irredeemably flawed. Rather than fostering unity and a deeper understanding of our shared past, the widespread effort to rewrite history deepens societal divides and fosters a sense of national shame, disregarding the progress America has made and the ideals that continue to inspire millions around the globe. </text></paragraph><paragraph id="HFC1CD10581624DD484818995C821171D"><enum>(2)</enum><text>The prior administration advanced this corrosive ideology. At Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania—where our Nation declared that all men are created equal—the prior administration sponsored training by an organization that advocates dismantling <quote>Western foundations</quote> and <quote>interrogating institutional racism</quote> and pressured National Historical Park rangers that their racial identity should dictate how they convey history to visiting Americans because America is purportedly racist. </text></paragraph><paragraph id="H9E0838F1C32E470C813B24DA73549C4D"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Once widely respected as a symbol of American excellence and a global icon of cultural achievement, the Smithsonian Institution has, in recent years, come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology. This shift has promoted narratives that portray American and Western values as inherently harmful and oppressive. For example, the Smithsonian American Art Museum today features <quote>The Shape of Power: Stories of Race and American Sculpture</quote>, an exhibit representing that <quote>[s]ocieties including the United States have used race to establish and maintain systems of power, privilege, and disenfranchisement.</quote> The exhibit further claims that <quote>sculpture has been a powerful tool in promoting scientific racism</quote> and promotes the view that race is not a biological reality but a social construct, stating <quote>Race is a human invention</quote>.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H8D3A60B502144DB68701329F68BC676E"><enum>(4)</enum><text>The National Museum of African American History and Culture has proclaimed that <quote>hard work</quote>, <quote>individualism</quote>, and <quote>the nuclear family</quote> are aspects of <quote>White culture</quote>. The forthcoming Smithsonian American Women's History Museum plans on celebrating the exploits of male athletes participating in women's sports.
