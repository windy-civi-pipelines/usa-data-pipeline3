Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Global Alzheimer’s Initiative Now Act.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following: 
(1)Alzheimer’s disease and dementia currently afflicts nearly 60 million people across the globe, a number that is projected to jump to more than 150 million by 2050. (2)There are now more global cases of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia than cancer and HIV combined, with 39 million diagnosed cases of HIV/AIDS and 20 million cases of cancer in 2022. 
(3)The pace of populations aging will challenge countries’ sovereign funds and health and social safety systems. (4)By 2050, the world’s population of people aged 60 years and older will double to 1.6 billion and reach a proportion of 22 percent of the world’s population. While the number of persons aged 80 or older is expected to triple by 2050. 
(5)The old-age dependency ratio, expressing the relative size of the older population compared with the working-age population, is projected to more than double by 2075 in the majority of the world. Rising dependency ratios will result in increasing pressures on old-age support systems, with fewer people of working age for each older person. (6)The prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia is growing most rapidly in low- and middle-income countries, which comprise more than 70 percent of the world’s Alzheimer’s disease and dementia cases. 
(7)Every year, Alzheimer’s disease and dementia costs the global economy more than $1.3 trillion and this is doubling every decade. (8)By 2050, the number of Americans living with Alzheimer’s disease and dementia is expected to reach 12.7 million, bringing the total cost to nearly $1 trillion each year, with minority populations in the United States disproportionately impacted by these trends.
(9)International Alzheimer’s research across all races and ethnicities directly benefits minority populations in the United States. (10)Women are disproportionately affected by Alzheimer’s disease and dementia, both directly and indirectly. Women experience higher disability-adjusted life years and mortality due to Alzheimer’s disease and dementia, but also provide 70 percent of care hours for people living with Alzheimer’s disease and dementia. 

        (11)
 The Davos Alzheimer’s Collaborative (DAC) is a public-private-patient venture, launched in 2021, that is transforming Alzheimer’s disease and dementia research, prevention, and care in low-income, middle-income, and high-income settings globally.
       
(12)DAC seeks to raise and deploy over $700 million over 6 years to accelerate innovation in drug development and transform the way healthcare systems prevent, diagnose, and treat Alzheimer’s disease and dementia for all people in all places. (13)In 2023, DAC supported 19 healthcare systems in 12 countries, including the United States. 
(14)The United States Government has traditionally been the largest funder of global health programs, with approximately $12 billion in funding in fiscal year 2024 for programs that cover the full range of global health challenges. (15)The United States Government has been a lead funder of multilateral health initiatives, such as Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, and the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative.

Section 3:
3.Statement of policyIt shall be the policy of the United States— (1)to lead global cooperative efforts to combat Alzheimer’s disease and dementia, including in countries with low-income economies and countries with middle-income economies (as such terms are defined by the World Bank) that represent the majority of future cases; and 
(2)to lead multilateral health initiatives, including the Davos Alzheimer’s Collaborative— (A)to develop diagnostics and treatments for diverse populations in the United States and across the globe; 

          (B)
 to promote international development cooperation; and  (C)to provide substantial leverage and burden sharing for United States investments.
