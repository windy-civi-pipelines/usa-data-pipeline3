Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Foreign Pollution Fee Act of 2025.

Section 2:
2.Sense of Congress; Purpose (a)Sense of CongressIt is the sense of Congress that— 
(1)the United States has led the world in carbon emissions reductions over the past 15 years, cutting more emissions than any other nation; (2)the United States economy is 55 percent more carbon-efficient than the global average; 
(3)on average, goods produced in China generate more than 3 times the carbon emissions of equivalent American-made goods, while Russian-made goods produce 5 times the emissions, which gives foreign polluters an unfair cost advantage over American manufacturers; (4)Federal environmental regulations impose an estimated $400,000,000,000 in annual costs on the economy of the United States, placing a disproportionate burden on American businesses and workers; 
(5)manufacturers in the United States face staggering environmental regulatory compliance costs, averaging $17,200 per employee, which are costs that foreign competitors, particularly in China, do not bear; (6)American businesses spend a higher percentage of their revenue on environmental compliance than many of their global competitors, making it harder to compete internationally; 
(7)as a result of these costs, companies in the United States have lost market share to foreign producers operating under weak, underenforced, or nonexistent environmental standards; (8)China is by far the world’s worst air and water polluter, responsible for 30 percent of global carbon emissions; 
(9)the Chinese Communist Party effectively subsidizes its exports by refusing to enforce basic environmental protections, undercutting responsible manufacturers in the United States; (10)China’s state-controlled industries operate as an extension of the Communist Party, using predatory trade practices, including environmental exploitation, to eliminate American competition and expand Beijing’s control over global markets; 
(11)United States trade policy has given foreign polluters a competitive edge at the expense of American workers for decades, rewarding bad actors while punishing responsible manufacturers in the United States; (12)China has been the primary beneficiary of these policies, with the United States losing approximately 5,000,000 jobs in the last 2 decades, with half of that loss directly attributable to the growing trade deficit with China; and 
(13)recognizing and rewarding manufacturers in the United States for their environmental leadership would strengthen domestic industry, create high-paying jobs, and reduce America’s dependence on high-emitting producers like China and Russia. (b)PurposeThe purpose of this Act is to level the playing field for American workers and manufacturers by ensuring that China and other foreign adversaries cannot exploit weak environmental standards, lack of enforcement, and noncompliance to gain an unfair advantage in global trade.

Section 3:
3.Rule of constructionNothing in this Act, or any amendments made by this Act, shall be construed to authorize the creation of any carbon tax, fee, pricing, or other mechanism that imposes additional costs to any covered product (as defined in section 4695(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as added by this Act) which is produced domestically and sold, used, further refined, or distributed within United States or exported to another country for sale or use.

4694.Calculation of pollution intensity 
(a)In generalFor purposes of determining the variable charge for covered products under section 4693 after the period described in section 4693(a)(1), the Secretary (in consultation with the Advisory Committee) shall— (1)develop consistent methods for calculating the pollution intensity of any covered product which are applied consistently across covered products and to the country of origin, and 
(2)make such methods publicly available. (b)Form (1)In generalWith respect to any covered product, the pollution intensity of such product shall be expressed based on the production-weight averaged pollution intensity associated with the manufacturing of such product in the country of origin. 
(2)Relevant emissionsThe pollution intensity of a covered product shall account for— (A)direct emissions, 
(B)indirect emissions, (C)precursor emissions, and 
(D)transportation emissions, associated with the manufacturing of such product. (3)SpecificityTo the maximum extent practicable, the pollution intensity of a covered product shall be specific to the applicable 6-digit HTS subheading number. 
(4)Exceptions 
(A)4-digitIn the case of a covered product for which data is not available to determine pollution intensity in a manner specific to the 6-digit HTS subheading number, the Secretary may determine the pollution intensity based on the applicable 4-digit HTS heading. (B)10-digitIn the case of a covered product for which data demonstrates significant differences in pollution intensity between 10-digit HTS statistical reporting numbers, the Secretary may determine pollution intensity based on the applicable 10-digit statistical reporting number. 
(c)Data 
(1)In generalTo the extent necessary for any determination with respect to any covered product, the Secretary (in consultation with the Advisory Committee) may use— (A)economic, statistical, and engineering models and analysis, 
(B)pollution monitoring data from facilities, satellites, and other pollution monitoring tools, provided that such data— (i)is publicly available, or 
(ii)is not publicly available but is able to be accessed and verified on a consistent basis by the Secretary or the head of any relevant Federal agency, (C)voluntarily reported data, provided that such data is— 
(i)a product of monitored emissions, and (ii)able to be verified by the Secretary,  
(D)the best available information on technology performance levels for the industrial sector that produces such product, and (E)manufacturing and pollution data which is specific to a covered product, including relevant data regarding— 
(i)the industrial sector which is associated with such product, and (ii)the country of origin. 
(2)Access to information 
(A)In generalThe head of every relevant Federal agency shall provide the Secretary with any information held by or otherwise available to the head of such Federal agency which is relevant to the calculation of pollution intensity. (B)ConfidentialityWith respect to any information or data relating to operational practices or manufacturing processes of any producer of a covered product which is provided to the Secretary pursuant to subparagraph (A), unless such information or data is otherwise publicly available, the head of any relevant Federal agency shall take such measures as are necessary to ensure that such information and data is aggregated and anonymized. 
(d)Methodology 
(1)In generalFor purposes of creating a process for calculating the pollution intensity of any covered product under subsection (a), the Secretary (in consultation with the Advisory Committee) shall— (A)use the best, and most internationally comparable, data available to establish the baseline pollution intensity with respect to such product, and 
(B)in the case of a covered product produced outside of the United States, base the calculation of the pollution intensity of such product on the process used to establish the baseline pollution intensity for such product. (2)Treatment of recycled materialsIn the case of any recycled material which is recycled (as defined in section 246.101(x) of title 40, Code of Federal Regulations) into— 
(A)an input material or precursor, or (B)a covered product,the Secretary shall deem such recycled material to have a pollution intensity as low as zero, as determined pursuant to such methods as are determined appropriate by the Secretary. 
(3)Treatment of carbon oxides 
(A)In generalAny carbon oxide captured from manufacturing processes by the producer of a covered product, or verifiably purchased by the producer of a covered product as an offset from a verified entity operating carbon removal infrastructure or projects, shall have the effect of reducing the pollution associated with the production of a covered product if— (i)in the case of any carbon oxide captured by the producer of the covered product, such carbon oxide is captured in the country of origin of such product and either— 
 
(I)utilized in the creation of a product in a manner which ensures that such carbon oxide does not escape into the atmosphere, or (II)verifiably sequestered in a manner which provides an accurate accounting of the storage of such carbon oxide, or 
(ii)in the case of an offset purchased by the producer of the covered product, such offset is a durable carbon removal credit representing carbon oxides removed from the atmosphere in the United States or in any country by an entity which is not designated as a foreign entity of concern, as verified in a manner which provides an accurate accounting of the utilization or sequestration of such carbon oxide, including the permanence of its storage. (B)AccountingSubject to subparagraph (C), any carbon oxide utilized or sequestered as described in subparagraph (A) shall be— 
(i)treated as a reduction in pollution associated with the production of a covered product based on the total tons of carbon oxide utilized or sequestered, (ii)eligible to offset relevant emissions based on the relevant carbon dioxide equivalent value, and 
(iii)verified pursuant to such process as is established by the Secretary (in consultation with the Administrator and the Secretary of Energy). (C)WeightingFor purposes of subparagraph (B), with respect to determining the amount of carbon oxide utilized or sequestered (as described in subparagraph (A)), such determination shall be conducted in such a manner as is determined appropriate by the Secretary (in consultation with the Administrator and the Secretary of Energy) so as to ensure that any reduction in the amount of pollution associated with the production of a covered product is commensurate with the level of durability and permanency of the captured carbon oxide which is utilized or sequestered, such that measures that provide for permanent carbon removal (such as sequestration of carbon oxides in geologic storage or other equivalent measures that have been scientifically determined to provide permanent storage) will be determined to result in a proportionally higher reduction in pollution than measures that provide for non-permanent carbon removal (such as measures that have been scientifically determined to have a lower period of storage or higher risks of reversal compared to geologic storage). 
(4)Treatment of facility-specific agreementsFor the purpose of determining the pollution intensity of any covered product which is produced in a foreign country, if— (A)such product is produced in a facility which is— 
(i)located in such country, and  (ii)covered by an agreement established under section 204 of the Foreign Pollution Fee Act of 2025, and 
(B)the pollution intensity of the product produced in such facility would otherwise lower the average pollution intensity associated with the production of such product in such country,the pollution intensity of the product produced in such facility shall not be included for purposes of calculating the pollution intensity associated with production of such product in the country of origin. (e)Alterations for foreign dataFor purposes of determining the pollution intensity values with respect to any country of origin for a covered product, if— 
(1)the baseline pollution intensity for such covered product was determined utilizing a methodology based on data described in subsection (c) which was provided at a more localized level, or in more granular detail, than the data available with respect to the country of origin, the pollution intensity otherwise determined under this section with respect to production of such covered product in such country of origin shall be increased by 20 percent, and (2)data with respect to the country of origin is unavailable or unverifiable, the Secretary may determine the baseline pollution intensity for the country using an inference that is adverse to the interests of the country in selecting from among the facts otherwise available to make the determination. 
(f)Foreign illustration of pollution intensity 
(1)In generalAny country may provide the Secretary with access to any verifiable data necessary to establish an alternative pollution intensity with respect to any covered product. (2)Alternative pollution intensity (A)In generalIn the case of a country which provides data described in paragraph (1), the Secretary may adjust the pollution intensity with respect to any covered product, provided that the country providing such data— 
(i)ensures the accuracy of all relevant data for all covered products, (ii)provides data at a level of granularity which satisfies the methods established by the Secretary, and 
(iii)provides the data consistently and in a manner that is verifiable by the Secretary. (B)Role of the Advisory CommitteeFor purposes of this paragraph, the Advisory Committee shall assist the Secretary by verifying relevant data and calculating adjustments to pollution intensities. 
(3)Publication of alternative pollution intensity valuesIn the case of any pollution intensity with respect to any covered product which is adjusted pursuant to paragraph (2)— (A)the Secretary shall publish such adjustment in the Federal Register, and 
(B)such adjustment shall take effect in the following calendar year. (g)Treatment of potential evasion and outliersIf the Secretary of Commerce (in consultation with the Secretary, the United States Trade Representative, the appropriate congressional committees, and any relevant Federal agency) determines that any country or any producer is evading or attempting to evade application of the fee imposed under section 4692, the Secretary may prohibit the importation of covered goods from that country or produced by that producer. 
4695.Treatment of international partnerships 
(a)Adjustment of fee for partner countriesIn the case of a covered product which is produced in a country which is a party to an international partnership agreement which satisfies the conditions under sections 201 and 202 of the Foreign Pollution Fee Act of 2025 (referred to in this section as a partner country), the fee under section 4692 shall be reduced in accordance with the terms of such agreement. (b)Elimination of treatment of foreign dataSection 4694(e) shall not apply to any partner country. 
4696.Covered productsThe term covered product means articles classifiable under the same 6-digit subheading number of the HTS within one of the following categories: (1)Aluminum classifiable under heading 7601 or any of headings 7603 through 7608 of the HTS, aluminum hydroxide classifiable under subheading 2818.30.00 of the HTS, and aluminum oxide classifiable under subheading 2818.20.00 of the HTS.

(2)make such methods publicly available. (b)Form (1)In generalWith respect to any covered product, the pollution intensity of such product shall be expressed based on the production-weight averaged pollution intensity associated with the manufacturing of such product in the country of origin. 
(2)Relevant emissionsThe pollution intensity of a covered product shall account for— (A)direct emissions, 
(B)indirect emissions, (C)precursor emissions, and 
(D)transportation emissions, associated with the manufacturing of such product. (3)SpecificityTo the maximum extent practicable, the pollution intensity of a covered product shall be specific to the applicable 6-digit HTS subheading number. 
(4)Exceptions 
(A)4-digitIn the case of a covered product for which data is not available to determine pollution intensity in a manner specific to the 6-digit HTS subheading number, the Secretary may determine the pollution intensity based on the applicable 4-digit HTS heading. (B)10-digitIn the case of a covered product for which data demonstrates significant differences in pollution intensity between 10-digit HTS statistical reporting numbers, the Secretary may determine pollution intensity based on the applicable 10-digit statistical reporting number. 
(c)Data 
(1)In generalTo the extent necessary for any determination with respect to any covered product, the Secretary (in consultation with the Advisory Committee) may use— (A)economic, statistical, and engineering models and analysis, 
(B)pollution monitoring data from facilities, satellites, and other pollution monitoring tools, provided that such data— (i)is publicly available, or 
(ii)is not publicly available but is able to be accessed and verified on a consistent basis by the Secretary or the head of any relevant Federal agency, (C)voluntarily reported data, provided that such data is— 
(i)a product of monitored emissions, and (ii)able to be verified by the Secretary,  
(D)the best available information on technology performance levels for the industrial sector that produces such product, and (E)manufacturing and pollution data which is specific to a covered product, including relevant data regarding— 
(i)the industrial sector which is associated with such product, and (ii)the country of origin. 
(2)Access to information 
(A)In generalThe head of every relevant Federal agency shall provide the Secretary with any information held by or otherwise available to the head of such Federal agency which is relevant to the calculation of pollution intensity. (B)ConfidentialityWith respect to any information or data relating to operational practices or manufacturing processes of any producer of a covered product which is provided to the Secretary pursuant to subparagraph (A), unless such information or data is otherwise publicly available, the head of any relevant Federal agency shall take such measures as are necessary to ensure that such information and data is aggregated and anonymized. 
(d)Methodology 
(1)In generalFor purposes of creating a process for calculating the pollution intensity of any covered product under subsection (a), the Secretary (in consultation with the Advisory Committee) shall— (A)use the best, and most internationally comparable, data available to establish the baseline pollution intensity with respect to such product, and 
(B)in the case of a covered product produced outside of the United States, base the calculation of the pollution intensity of such product on the process used to establish the baseline pollution intensity for such product. (2)Treatment of recycled materialsIn the case of any recycled material which is recycled (as defined in section 246.101(x) of title 40, Code of Federal Regulations) into— 
(A)an input material or precursor, or (B)a covered product,the Secretary shall deem such recycled material to have a pollution intensity as low as zero, as determined pursuant to such methods as are determined appropriate by the Secretary. 
(3)Treatment of carbon oxides 
(A)In generalAny carbon oxide captured from manufacturing processes by the producer of a covered product, or verifiably purchased by the producer of a covered product as an offset from a verified entity operating carbon removal infrastructure or projects, shall have the effect of reducing the pollution associated with the production of a covered product if— (i)in the case of any carbon oxide captured by the producer of the covered product, such carbon oxide is captured in the country of origin of such product and either— 
 
(I)utilized in the creation of a product in a manner which ensures that such carbon oxide does not escape into the atmosphere, or (II)verifiably sequestered in a manner which provides an accurate accounting of the storage of such carbon oxide, or 
(ii)in the case of an offset purchased by the producer of the covered product, such offset is a durable carbon removal credit representing carbon oxides removed from the atmosphere in the United States or in any country by an entity which is not designated as a foreign entity of concern, as verified in a manner which provides an accurate accounting of the utilization or sequestration of such carbon oxide, including the permanence of its storage. (B)AccountingSubject to subparagraph (C), any carbon oxide utilized or sequestered as described in subparagraph (A) shall be— 
(i)treated as a reduction in pollution associated with the production of a covered product based on the total tons of carbon oxide utilized or sequestered, (ii)eligible to offset relevant emissions based on the relevant carbon dioxide equivalent value, and 
(iii)verified pursuant to such process as is established by the Secretary (in consultation with the Administrator and the Secretary of Energy). (C)WeightingFor purposes of subparagraph (B), with respect to determining the amount of carbon oxide utilized or sequestered (as described in subparagraph (A)), such determination shall be conducted in such a manner as is determined appropriate by the Secretary (in consultation with the Administrator and the Secretary of Energy) so as to ensure that any reduction in the amount of pollution associated with the production of a covered product is commensurate with the level of durability and permanency of the captured carbon oxide which is utilized or sequestered, such that measures that provide for permanent carbon removal (such as sequestration of carbon oxides in geologic storage or other equivalent measures that have been scientifically determined to provide permanent storage) will be determined to result in a proportionally higher reduction in pollution than measures that provide for non-permanent carbon removal (such as measures that have been scientifically determined to have a lower period of storage or higher risks of reversal compared to geologic storage). 
(4)Treatment of facility-specific agreementsFor the purpose of determining the pollution intensity of any covered product which is produced in a foreign country, if— (A)such product is produced in a facility which is— 
(i)located in such country, and  (ii)covered by an agreement established under section 204 of the Foreign Pollution Fee Act of 2025, and 
(B)the pollution intensity of the product produced in such facility would otherwise lower the average pollution intensity associated with the production of such product in such country,the pollution intensity of the product produced in such facility shall not be included for purposes of calculating the pollution intensity associated with production of such product in the country of origin. (e)Alterations for foreign dataFor purposes of determining the pollution intensity values with respect to any country of origin for a covered product, if— 
(1)the baseline pollution intensity for such covered product was determined utilizing a methodology based on data described in subsection (c) which was provided at a more localized level, or in more granular detail, than the data available with respect to the country of origin, the pollution intensity otherwise determined under this section with respect to production of such covered product in such country of origin shall be increased by 20 percent, and (2)data with respect to the country of origin is unavailable or unverifiable, the Secretary may determine the baseline pollution intensity for the country using an inference that is adverse to the interests of the country in selecting from among the facts otherwise available to make the determination. 
(f)Foreign illustration of pollution intensity 
(1)In generalAny country may provide the Secretary with access to any verifiable data necessary to establish an alternative pollution intensity with respect to any covered product. (2)Alternative pollution intensity (A)In generalIn the case of a country which provides data described in paragraph (1), the Secretary may adjust the pollution intensity with respect to any covered product, provided that the country providing such data— 
(i)ensures the accuracy of all relevant data for all covered products, (ii)provides data at a level of granularity which satisfies the methods established by the Secretary, and 
(iii)provides the data consistently and in a manner that is verifiable by the Secretary. (B)Role of the Advisory CommitteeFor purposes of this paragraph, the Advisory Committee shall assist the Secretary by verifying relevant data and calculating adjustments to pollution intensities. 
(3)Publication of alternative pollution intensity valuesIn the case of any pollution intensity with respect to any covered product which is adjusted pursuant to paragraph (2)— (A)the Secretary shall publish such adjustment in the Federal Register, and 
(B)such adjustment shall take effect in the following calendar year. (g)Treatment of potential evasion and outliersIf the Secretary of Commerce (in consultation with the Secretary, the United States Trade Representative, the appropriate congressional committees, and any relevant Federal agency) determines that any country or any producer is evading or attempting to evade application of the fee imposed under section 4692, the Secretary may prohibit the importation of covered goods from that country or produced by that producer.

II 
119th CONGRESS1st Session 
S. 1325 
IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES 
 
April 8, 2025 
Mr. Cassidy (for himself and Mr. Graham) introduced the following bill; which was read twice and referred to the Committee on Finance 
 
A BILL 
To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to impose a fee on certain products imported into the United States based on the pollution intensity associated with the production of such products, and for other purposes. 
 
 
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Foreign Pollution Fee Act of 2025. 2.Sense of Congress; Purpose (a)Sense of CongressIt is the sense of Congress that— 
(1)the United States has led the world in carbon emissions reductions over the past 15 years, cutting more emissions than any other nation; (2)the United States economy is 55 percent more carbon-efficient than the global average; 
(3)on average, goods produced in China generate more than 3 times the carbon emissions of equivalent American-made goods, while Russian-made goods produce 5 times the emissions, which gives foreign polluters an unfair cost advantage over American manufacturers; (4)Federal environmental regulations impose an estimated $400,000,000,000 in annual costs on the economy of the United States, placing a disproportionate burden on American businesses and workers; 
(5)manufacturers in the United States face staggering environmental regulatory compliance costs, averaging $17,200 per employee, which are costs that foreign competitors, particularly in China, do not bear; (6)American businesses spend a higher percentage of their revenue on environmental compliance than many of their global competitors, making it harder to compete internationally; 
(7)as a result of these costs, companies in the United States have lost market share to foreign producers operating under weak, underenforced, or nonexistent environmental standards; (8)China is by far the world’s worst air and water polluter, responsible for 30 percent of global carbon emissions; 
(9)the Chinese Communist Party effectively subsidizes its exports by refusing to enforce basic environmental protections, undercutting responsible manufacturers in the United States; (10)China’s state-controlled industries operate as an extension of the Communist Party, using predatory trade practices, including environmental exploitation, to eliminate American competition and expand Beijing’s control over global markets; 
(11)United States trade policy has given foreign polluters a competitive edge at the expense of American workers for decades, rewarding bad actors while punishing responsible manufacturers in the United States; (12)China has been the primary beneficiary of these policies, with the United States losing approximately 5,000,000 jobs in the last 2 decades, with half of that loss directly attributable to the growing trade deficit with China; and 
(13)recognizing and rewarding manufacturers in the United States for their environmental leadership would strengthen domestic industry, create high-paying jobs, and reduce America’s dependence on high-emitting producers like China and Russia. (b)PurposeThe purpose of this Act is to level the playing field for American workers and manufacturers by ensuring that China and other foreign adversaries cannot exploit weak environmental standards, lack of enforcement, and noncompliance to gain an unfair advantage in global trade. 
3.Rule of constructionNothing in this Act, or any amendments made by this Act, shall be construed to authorize the creation of any carbon tax, fee, pricing, or other mechanism that imposes additional costs to any covered product (as defined in section 4695(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as added by this Act) which is produced domestically and sold, used, further refined, or distributed within United States or exported to another country for sale or use.

(B)10-digitIn the case of a covered product for which data demonstrates significant differences in pollution intensity between 10-digit HTS statistical reporting numbers, the Secretary may determine pollution intensity based on the applicable 10-digit statistical reporting number. 
(c)Data 
(1)In generalTo the extent necessary for any determination with respect to any covered product, the Secretary (in consultation with the Advisory Committee) may use— (A)economic, statistical, and engineering models and analysis, 
(B)pollution monitoring data from facilities, satellites, and other pollution monitoring tools, provided that such data— (i)is publicly available, or 
(ii)is not publicly available but is able to be accessed and verified on a consistent basis by the Secretary or the head of any relevant Federal agency, (C)voluntarily reported data, provided that such data is— 
(i)a product of monitored emissions, and (ii)able to be verified by the Secretary,  
(D)the best available information on technology performance levels for the industrial sector that produces such product, and (E)manufacturing and pollution data which is specific to a covered product, including relevant data regarding— 
(i)the industrial sector which is associated with such product, and (ii)the country of origin. 
(2)Access to information 
(A)In generalThe head of every relevant Federal agency shall provide the Secretary with any information held by or otherwise available to the head of such Federal agency which is relevant to the calculation of pollution intensity. (B)ConfidentialityWith respect to any information or data relating to operational practices or manufacturing processes of any producer of a covered product which is provided to the Secretary pursuant to subparagraph (A), unless such information or data is otherwise publicly available, the head of any relevant Federal agency shall take such measures as are necessary to ensure that such information and data is aggregated and anonymized. 
(d)Methodology 
(1)In generalFor purposes of creating a process for calculating the pollution intensity of any covered product under subsection (a), the Secretary (in consultation with the Advisory Committee) shall— (A)use the best, and most internationally comparable, data available to establish the baseline pollution intensity with respect to such product, and 
(B)in the case of a covered product produced outside of the United States, base the calculation of the pollution intensity of such product on the process used to establish the baseline pollution intensity for such product. (2)Treatment of recycled materialsIn the case of any recycled material which is recycled (as defined in section 246.101(x) of title 40, Code of Federal Regulations) into— 
(A)an input material or precursor, or (B)a covered product,the Secretary shall deem such recycled material to have a pollution intensity as low as zero, as determined pursuant to such methods as are determined appropriate by the Secretary. 
(3)Treatment of carbon oxides 
(A)In generalAny carbon oxide captured from manufacturing processes by the producer of a covered product, or verifiably purchased by the producer of a covered product as an offset from a verified entity operating carbon removal infrastructure or projects, shall have the effect of reducing the pollution associated with the production of a covered product if— (i)in the case of any carbon oxide captured by the producer of the covered product, such carbon oxide is captured in the country of origin of such product and either— 
 
(I)utilized in the creation of a product in a manner which ensures that such carbon oxide does not escape into the atmosphere, or (II)verifiably sequestered in a manner which provides an accurate accounting of the storage of such carbon oxide, or 
(ii)in the case of an offset purchased by the producer of the covered product, such offset is a durable carbon removal credit representing carbon oxides removed from the atmosphere in the United States or in any country by an entity which is not designated as a foreign entity of concern, as verified in a manner which provides an accurate accounting of the utilization or sequestration of such carbon oxide, including the permanence of its storage. (B)AccountingSubject to subparagraph (C), any carbon oxide utilized or sequestered as described in subparagraph (A) shall be— 
(i)treated as a reduction in pollution associated with the production of a covered product based on the total tons of carbon oxide utilized or sequestered, (ii)eligible to offset relevant emissions based on the relevant carbon dioxide equivalent value, and 
(iii)verified pursuant to such process as is established by the Secretary (in consultation with the Administrator and the Secretary of Energy). (C)WeightingFor purposes of subparagraph (B), with respect to determining the amount of carbon oxide utilized or sequestered (as described in subparagraph (A)), such determination shall be conducted in such a manner as is determined appropriate by the Secretary (in consultation with the Administrator and the Secretary of Energy) so as to ensure that any reduction in the amount of pollution associated with the production of a covered product is commensurate with the level of durability and permanency of the captured carbon oxide which is utilized or sequestered, such that measures that provide for permanent carbon removal (such as sequestration of carbon oxides in geologic storage or other equivalent measures that have been scientifically determined to provide permanent storage) will be determined to result in a proportionally higher reduction in pollution than measures that provide for non-permanent carbon removal (such as measures that have been scientifically determined to have a lower period of storage or higher risks of reversal compared to geologic storage). 
(4)Treatment of facility-specific agreementsFor the purpose of determining the pollution intensity of any covered product which is produced in a foreign country, if— (A)such product is produced in a facility which is— 
(i)located in such country, and  (ii)covered by an agreement established under section 204 of the Foreign Pollution Fee Act of 2025, and 
(B)the pollution intensity of the product produced in such facility would otherwise lower the average pollution intensity associated with the production of such product in such country,the pollution intensity of the product produced in such facility shall not be included for purposes of calculating the pollution intensity associated with production of such product in the country of origin. (e)Alterations for foreign dataFor purposes of determining the pollution intensity values with respect to any country of origin for a covered product, if— 
(1)the baseline pollution intensity for such covered product was determined utilizing a methodology based on data described in subsection (c) which was provided at a more localized level, or in more granular detail, than the data available with respect to the country of origin, the pollution intensity otherwise determined under this section with respect to production of such covered product in such country of origin shall be increased by 20 percent, and (2)data with respect to the country of origin is unavailable or unverifiable, the Secretary may determine the baseline pollution intensity for the country using an inference that is adverse to the interests of the country in selecting from among the facts otherwise available to make the determination. 
(f)Foreign illustration of pollution intensity 
(1)In generalAny country may provide the Secretary with access to any verifiable data necessary to establish an alternative pollution intensity with respect to any covered product. (2)Alternative pollution intensity (A)In generalIn the case of a country which provides data described in paragraph (1), the Secretary may adjust the pollution intensity with respect to any covered product, provided that the country providing such data— 
(i)ensures the accuracy of all relevant data for all covered products, (ii)provides data at a level of granularity which satisfies the methods established by the Secretary, and 
(iii)provides the data consistently and in a manner that is verifiable by the Secretary. (B)Role of the Advisory CommitteeFor purposes of this paragraph, the Advisory Committee shall assist the Secretary by verifying relevant data and calculating adjustments to pollution intensities.
