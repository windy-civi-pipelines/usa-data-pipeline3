Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following:(1)The National Academy for Fire Prevention and Control (in this section referred to as the Academy) of the United States Fire Administration, and the Emergency Management Institute, are located at the National Emergency Training Center in Emmitsburg, Maryland.(2)Congress directed the establishment of the Academy in accordance with section 7 of the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 (15 U.S.C. 2206) to advance the professional development of fire service personnel.(3)The Academy is the American fire service war college and provides critical training and education programs for our nation’s first responders.(4)Tens of thousands of career and volunteer firefighters from departments across the country benefit from courses at the Academy annually.(5)In 2017, an overwhelming majority of students at the Academy reported that their coursework helped improve their individual skills and enhanced their local fire department’s readiness.(6)In fiscal year 2023, more than 40,000 firefighters participated in courses with the Academy. After participating in these courses, 90 percent of supervisors shared that their firefighters were better prepared to respond to emergencies as a result of their training at the Academy.(7)At a time when wildfires have ravaged—and continue to threaten—communities across the nation, the collaboration and education managed by the Academy has never been more important to secure the future of fire services.(8)Given the importance of the programs at the Academy, it is critical to clarify the authority of the Academy to cancel courses and programming, and to require proper notice be given to Congress before any large-scale closures happen.
