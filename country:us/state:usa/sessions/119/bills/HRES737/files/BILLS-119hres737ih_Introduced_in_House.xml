<whereas><text>Whereas military and veterans continue to be at great risk to die by suicide amongst the United States population;</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas military and veterans are nearly two times as likely to die by suicide compared to their civilian counterparts, and over 20 veterans and military die by suicide each day in the United States;</text></whereas>
