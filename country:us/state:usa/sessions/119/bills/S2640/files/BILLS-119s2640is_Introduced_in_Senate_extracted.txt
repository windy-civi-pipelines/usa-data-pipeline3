 Notwithstanding any other provision of law, arbitration may be used to settle a controversy arising from or relating to a provision of a covered contract only if, after the controversy arises, all parties to the controversy consent, in writing, to use arbitration to settle the controversy.

 In this section, the term covered contract means a contract for the purchase of a ticket for transportation on a covered passenger vessel.

                                    Arbitration
 Notwithstanding any other provision of law, arbitration may be used to settle a controversy arising from or relating to a provision of a covered contract only if, after the controversy arises, all parties to the controversy consent, in writing, to use arbitration to settle the controversy.
