IV119th CONGRESS1st SessionH. RES. 363IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESApril 30, 2025Ms. Kaptur (for herself, Mr. Latta, Mrs. Dingell, and Ms. Schakowsky) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Natural ResourcesRESOLUTIONExpressing support for the designation of the week of May 9 through May 18, 2025, as National American Birding Week. 
Whereas approximately 3,500,000,000 songbirds, raptors, shore birds, and waterfowl representing over 350 species migrate north through the United States to breeding grounds every spring from wintering grounds in the southern United States, Mexico, and the tropics; Whereas populations of many migratory bird species are in decline due to habitat loss, predation, and collisions with buildings, utility infrastructure, and vehicles; 
Whereas an estimated 96,000,000 American birders spend almost $107,000,000,000 annually on birdwatching activities, creating 1,400,000 jobs and billions in employment income and Federal and State tax revenue; and Whereas annual birding events, such as the Biggest Week in American Birding, sponsored by the Black Swamp Bird Observatory in Oak Harbor, Ohio, in collaboration with the Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge, the Magee Marsh State Wildlife Area, and a coalition of public, nonprofit, and private partners, leverage government, nonprofit, and private resources to promote conservation of migratory bird populations and economic development through a multifaceted approach that combines research, education, and outreach: Now, therefore, be it 
That the House of Representatives— (1)supports the designation of National American Birding Week; 
(2)recognizes that birding is a pastime that generates billions in economic benefits annually; (3)understands that migratory bird populations face an array of natural and human-caused threats to their survival; 
(4)applauds coordinated efforts by Federal, State, and local governments, conservation organizations, and businesses to promote conservation of migratory birds and economic development through birding; and (5)encourages birders and the public at large to attend events such as the Biggest Week in American Birding to learn about bird migration and to support efforts by governments, conservation organizations, and businesses to preserve migratory bird populations.
