Patton.(4)In his welcoming speech, Patton said, I would never have asked for you if you weren't good. I have nothing but the best in my Army. I don't care what color you are as long as you go up there and kill those….(5)After entering combat in late fall 1944, the 761st lived up to their motto, Come Out Fighting, enduring 183 days of combat without being pulled from the line.(6)The 761st played a crucial role in numerous battles including the Battle of the Bulge and helped break out the encircled American paratroopers in the town of Bastogne.(7)During their time in combat, the 761st inflicted 130,000 casualties on the Germans while enduring a casualty rate of almost 50 percent with the loss of 71 tanks.(8)As the spearhead for several of Patton’s moves toward Germany, they were the first American unit to break through the Siegfried Line and they were one of the first American units to link up with the Russian Army at the Enns River at Steyr, Austria.(9)Sadly, like other Black soldiers in World War II, members of the 761st did not receive the recognition that was due them upon returning home, and instead faced prejudice at home after the war.(10)The accomplishments of the 761st were largely unrecognized until 1978 when, over three decades after the war, the battalion finally received a Presidential Unit Citation.(11)The citation acknowledges the extraordinary gallantry, courage, professionalism, and high esprit de corps displayed in the accomplishment of unusually difficult and hazardous operations in the European Theater of Operations.(12)In addition to that citation, individual members of the 761st had earned the following: 1 Medal of Honor, 11 Silver Stars, and approximately 300 Purple Hearts.(13)The United States is eternally grateful to the soldiers of the 761st Tank Battalion for their crucial role in the success of Allied forces in Europe and for helping ensure freedom around the globe.
