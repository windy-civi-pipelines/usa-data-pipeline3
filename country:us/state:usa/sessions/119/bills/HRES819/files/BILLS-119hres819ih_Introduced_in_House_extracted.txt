IV119th CONGRESS1st SessionH. RES. 819IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESOctober 17, 2025Mr. Suozzi (for himself and Mrs. Kim) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Oversight and Government ReformRESOLUTIONRecognizing the contributions made to the United States by the Indian American diaspora and condemning recent acts of racism against Indian Americans. 
Whereas the partnership between India and the United States, based on shared principles of democracy, religious pluralism, human rights, freedom, and the rule of law, stands as one of the most important democratic partnerships in the world; Whereas the strong and mutually beneficial people-to-people ties between India and the United States are the backbone of this partnership; 
Whereas the Indian diaspora, a community of over 5,200,000 in the United States, has excelled in all areas of United States life, with over 77 percent of Americans of Indian heritage attaining college degrees and serving in public life, as elected officials, lawyers, doctors, nurses, judges, members of law enforcement, teachers, diplomats, businessmen, and members of the Armed Forces; Whereas Indian Americans come from a variety of vibrant and diverse religious backgrounds including Hindu, Sikh, Muslim, Christian, Buddhist, and Jain communities; 
Whereas Indian Americans continue to face hate incidents, often fueled by racism, religious intolerance, misinformation, inflammatory rhetoric, and racial scapegoating; and Whereas anti-Hindu and anti-Indian sentiment has also surged online, with South Asians, including Hindus and Sikhs, experiencing a doubling of reported harassment incidents, corresponding with heightened visibility of Indian Americans in national politics: Now, therefore, be it  
That the House of Representatives— (1)recognizes Indian Americans and their contributions to the strength of America; 
(2)acknowledges the people-to-people bonds of friendship between India and the United States Indian American diaspora; (3)recognizes the monumental role played by Americans of Indian heritage and their profound impact on the cultural, economic, and scientific advancement of the Nation; and 
(4)condemns all acts of hate, discrimination, and violence against Indian Americans and the broader South Asian community, including those targeted for their Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Muslim, or other religious or cultural identity.
