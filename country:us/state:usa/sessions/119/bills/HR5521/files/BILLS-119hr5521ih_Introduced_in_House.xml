You'll be living in some of the most impoverished countries of the world, working in food production, soil conservation, fisheries production, forest preservation, and water supply development. By bringing your training and skills to bear on the underlying problems of agricultural and economic development, you can help your host nations make the difficult but vital journey from dependence on short-term aid to self-sufficiency. Vice President Bush returned from his trip to the famine-stricken regions of Africa, he gave me a personal account of the heartbreaking conditions in that land. While there, he visited one Peace Corps project, and he told me of the outstanding work of the Peace Corps volunteers. The crisis in Africa is severe and the problems deeply rooted, but relief efforts are already making a great difference.</quote>.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H6BC6FA593D594A3D9E02983A1EF71364"><enum>(10)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Peace Corps senior leaders, staff, and Volunteers have honored President Kennedy’s vision for the Peace Corps and his legacy. During a March 1, 1996, speech for the 35th anniversary of the Peace Corps, Sargent Shriver said, <quote>The Peace Corps represents some, if not all, of the best virtues in this society.

The importance of the Peace Corps was reinforced in a May 24, 2017, opinion article by General Colin Powell, retired Secretary of State, when he said, <quote>Indeed, we’re strongest when the face of America isn’t only a soldier carrying a gun but a diplomat negotiating peace, a Peace Corps Volunteer bringing clean water to a village, or a relief worker stepping off a cargo plane as floodwaters rise.</quote>.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HFA861CD45E2446FEB9065C99D1B38F2F"><enum>(12)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The global accomplishments of Volunteers toward world peace and friendship and their resolute service to the United States are deserving of robust public recognition and respect.

According to the Fallen Peace Corps Volunteers Memorial Project, more than 300 Volunteers have died in service, or following close of service as a result of service-related causes, since the Peace Corps began in 1961.

Though they were evacuated for health reasons from their assigned projects, they continued to volunteer when they returned to the United States to support the national response to a global health crisis. Former Peace Corps Director, Josephine (Jody) Olsen, who supervised the complex and immediate recall process, wrote, <quote>Odysseys by individual Peace Corps Volunteers forged over six decades made the total evacuation of seven thousand Volunteers due of Covid–19 in 2020 possible. As I sent out the immediate evacuation order on March 15, I trusted that in sixty-one countries, the thousands of host country families, teachers, clinic directors, local taxi drivers, community security officers, airlines, and medical officials that support Volunteers would selflessly offer their help. These thousands shared painful good-byes and supported the safe movement of all of the volunteers to capital cities, international airports, charter flights to the US over the course of nine days without illness or accident.</quote>. When Volunteers returned to the United States, many shifted their work to support domestic initiatives, including COVID–19 surveillance and health programs in collaboration with the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA connected Volunteers who returned to the United States with roles in public health for pandemic response efforts in the United States. Meanwhile, the Peace Corps launched the Virtual Service Pilot, allowing Volunteers who returned to the United States and other United States citizens to work remotely with international partners on community projects across sectors like health, education, and agriculture. The Virtual Service Pilot expanded rapidly, demonstrating the potential for virtual service to complement traditional Peace Corps work, providing flexible opportunities for such Volunteers to contribute globally from home.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H08F7CC5243E8488AACFC8D1C527DA285"><enum>(15)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Returned Volunteers promote a better understanding of other peoples and cultures when they share their experiences and knowledge about their service overseas with Americans at home, the third goal of the Peace Corps described in paragraph 8(C). With regard to the third goal, the Peace Corps’ Congressional Budget Justification for Fiscal Year 2026 states that by increasing mutual understanding and lasting ties between the people of the United States and other countries, the Peace Corps helps create better trading partners, strengthens relationships with allies, inhibits extremism, and counteracts the growing influence of America’s adversaries. Volunteers strengthen U.S. national security through improved relations with host governments and by showcasing America as an international leader. The agency also helps cultivate the next generation of U.S. civic and business leaders. Volunteers return home and, for long after the conclusion of their service, contribute the adaptive leadership and entrepreneurial skills they gained during service to American communities.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H41B43DBFF3414973B680C88CD3A3633A"><enum>(16)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">On December 6, 1987, about 120,000 Volunteers and Peace Corps staff received the Beyond War Award.

In a June 27, 2002, letter to the Nobel Peace Prize Committee, 10 members of the 107th Congress signed the letter saying, <quote>The impact of Volunteers on international peace through understanding and cooperation goes far beyond development projects. Volunteers bring people and cultures together. They share ideas and ideals of their home community, but they also learn to speak the language, eat the food, sing the songs, and incorporate the qualities of their host communities into their own lives. They travel overseas to represent the United States, and they return home to represent the world within the United States. The central mission of all Volunteers, both overseas and after they return home, is peace. The Peace Corps and the community of Returned Peace Corps Volunteers, represented by the National Peace Corps Association, create the climate, the conditions, the momentum, and the spirit of peace that is needed all over the world. For this reason, they deserve the Nobel Peace Prize.</quote>.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H040FF10DF1CA40EBA498CD897E75C613"><enum>(18)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">In February 2011, Members of the 112th Congress recommended to President Barack Obama that the Peace Corps should be nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize. The letter to President Obama, authored by Congressman Sam Farr, said, <quote>For a half-century Peace Corps has served as a vehicle of peace and hope for impoverished communities around the world. Now more than ever, as the world suffers from divisive transnational conflicts and escalating threats, Peace Corps continues to stand as an unparalleled beacon of peace and optimism. Bestowing the Peace Corps with the Nobel Peace Prize will undoubtedly work to promote volunteerism and inspire the next generation of Americans to be peaceful stewards of both their country and the world.</quote>.</text></paragraph></subsection><subsection id="H9112286AFC4B432D9F2E0B023B36050E"><enum>(b)</enum><header>Sense of Congress</header><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">It is the sense of Congress that—</text><paragraph id="H2C52DF02B706473086AD73F3192DCF01"><enum>(1)</enum><text>the Volunteers should be acknowledged and thanked publicly for their service to the United States and their host countries whenever the appropriate occasions arise.
