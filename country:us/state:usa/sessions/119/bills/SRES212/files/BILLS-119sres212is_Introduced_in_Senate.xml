        </whereas>
        <whereas>
 <text>Whereas on May 30, 2022, the IAEA reported that the Islamic Republic of Iran had achieved a stockpile of 43.3 kilograms (95.5 pounds) of 60 percent highly enriched uranium, which is roughly enough material to construct a nuclear weapon;</text>
        </whereas>
        <whereas>
 <text>Whereas on February 27, 2023, the IAEA reported that the Islamic Republic of Iran had enriched uranium to 83.7 percent, which is just short of the 90 percent threshold for weapons-grade fissile material;</text>

        <whereas>
 <text>Whereas on September 16, 2023, the IAEA reported that the Islamic Republic of Iran banned the activities of nearly <fraction>1/3</fraction> of the IAEA’s most experienced nuclear inspectors in Iran, a decision that, according to IAEA Director-General Rafael Grossi, harmed the IAEA’s ability to monitor Iran’s nuclear program;</text>

 <text>Whereas, on December 28, 2023, the Governments of the United States, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom jointly declared, <quote>The production of high-enriched uranium by Iran has no credible civilian justification</quote>;</text>
        </whereas>
        <whereas>
 <text>Whereas, on July 23, 2024, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence published an assessment, in accordance with the Iran Nuclear Weapons Capability and Terrorism Monitoring Act of 2022 (<external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/22/8701">22 U.S.C. 8701</external-xref> note; <external-xref legal-doc="public-law" parsable-cite="pl/117/263">Public Law 117–263</external-xref>), which stated, the Islamic Republic of Iran has <quote>undertaken activities that better position it to produce a nuclear device, if it chooses to do so</quote>;</text>
        </whereas>
        <whereas>
 <text>Whereas, on November 15, 2024, the IAEA reported that the Islamic Republic of Iran has continued to expand its enrichment facilities and install additional advanced centrifuges, including at the Natanz Nuclear Facility, where there are 15 cascades of advanced centrifuges, and the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant, where there are advanced preparations for the expansion of the facility;</text>

        <whereas>
 <text>Whereas, on February 26, 2025, the IAEA reported that the Islamic Republic of Iran has between 5 and 7 metric tons of enriched uranium, and had increased its total stockpile of 60 percent highly enriched uranium to 274.8 kilograms (605.83 pounds), which, if further enriched, could be sufficient to produce 6 nuclear weapons;</text>

        <whereas>
 <text>Whereas, on April 7, 2025, the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, stated that the United States and Israel are <quote>both united in the goal that Iran does not ever get nuclear weapons.

        <whereas>
 <text>Whereas, on April 7, 2025, President of the United States Donald Trump echoed that position, stating, <quote>You know, it’s not a complicated formula. Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. That’s all there is.</quote>;</text>
        </whereas>
        <whereas>
 <text>Whereas, on April 8, 2025, the Islamic Republic of Iran rejected the dismantlement of its nuclear program, stating, <quote>Trump wants a new deal: end Iran’s regional influence, dismantle its nuclear program, and halt its missile work. These are unacceptable to Tehran. Our nuclear program cannot be dismantled</quote>; and</text>
