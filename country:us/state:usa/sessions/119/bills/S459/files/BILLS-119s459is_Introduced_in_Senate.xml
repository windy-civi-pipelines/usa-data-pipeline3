Among other reasons, when an emergency arises, it can be too late, and too dangerous, to erect an effective antenna. However, amateur stations have been shown to be frequently and increasingly precluded by unreasonable private land use restrictions, including restrictive covenants.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HE9E702AE38A44E24B38CA1513280E4D4"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Commission regulations have for more than 3 decades prohibited State and local regulation of amateur station antenna structures that precludes or fails to reasonably accommodate amateur service communications, or that does not constitute the minimum practicable regulation to accomplish a legitimate State or local purpose. The policy of the Commission has been and is to require States and localities to permit erection of a station antenna structure at heights and dimensions sufficient to reasonably accommodate amateur service communications. The Commission struck an appropriate balance by enabling effective use of the amateur service without burdening localities and adjoining properties.</text></paragraph><paragraph
