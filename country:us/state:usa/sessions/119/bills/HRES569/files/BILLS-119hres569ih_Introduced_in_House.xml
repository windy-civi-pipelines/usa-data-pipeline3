situations are comparably qualified;</text></paragraph></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas these disparities highlight systemic issues in the housing market that disproportionately disadvantage Black, Latino, and AANHPI communities, emphasizing the need for ongoing efforts to address and rectify discriminatory lending and appraisal practices;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the racial wealth

services are designed to meet the diverse needs of all populations, especially historically underserved or marginalized communities;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, without an equity lens, systemic barriers, such as cost, transportation, and a lack of culturally competent services, may prevent some groups from accessing essential resources;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas government agencies and organizations that integrate diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility principles develop policies that intentionally reduce disparities in service accessibility;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility-focused transportation policies could ensure rural communities and individuals with disabilities have equal access to public transit;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas a diverse workforce in service-oriented fields, such as education, health care, and social services, leads to better

mental health;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas these and other initiatives that advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility promote equal access to opportunities and resources, foster an environment of respect and belonging, ensure that every individual, regardless of background, can fully participate in all aspects of society, and are essential to creating a culture where all individuals are valued and included;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas President Donald Trumpâ€™s Executive orders on diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility represent a regressive step, undermining decades of progress toward equal opportunity in the United States, and misconstrue the fundamental purpose of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility efforts;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the idea that diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility initiatives do not consider merit is a false and harmful narrative that misunderstands both concepts;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, rather than lowering standards, diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility initiatives ensure that merit is measured in ways that are more accurate, inclusive, and aligned with real-world potential, benefitting schools, workplaces, and society at large;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, contrary to the Trump administrationâ€™s claims, diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility initiatives are not about preferential treatment or quotas but leveling the playing field;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas dismantling these programs disregards the persistent inequalities that necessitate their existence and signals a troubling departure from the commitment of the United States to civil rights and equal opportunity for all; and</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas attacks on initiatives that advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility make the United States less prosperous, fair, and safe: Now,
