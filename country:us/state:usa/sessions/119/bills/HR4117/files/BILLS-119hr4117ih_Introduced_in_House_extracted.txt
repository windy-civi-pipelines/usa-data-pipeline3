2.FindingsCongress finds the following: 
(1)Fuel emissions regulations increase costs for consumers and manufacturers. (2)Overlapping and ever-changing fuel emissions standards, whether imposed by the Environmental Protection Agency, the State of California, or through Corporate Average Fuel Economy regulations, create long-term uncertainty for manufacturers. 
(3)This fragmented regulatory environment stifles innovation, disrupts supply chains, and burdens manufacturers and businesses, especially small and medium-sized auto suppliers. (4)Conflicting fuel emissions standards force manufacturers to comply with multiple sets of costly and inconsistent regulations, further reducing efficiency and raising production costs, which are ultimately passed onto the consumer. 
(5)Eliminating fuel emissions standards at the Federal and State level will help restore regulatory certainty, lower costs for families, and strengthen manufacturing in the United States to ensure economic freedom.
