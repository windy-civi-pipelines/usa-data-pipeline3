Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Identifying Regulatory Barriers to Housing Supply Act.

Section 2:
2.PurposeThe purpose of this Act is to discourage the use of overly burdensome land use policies and remove barriers to making housing more affordable in order to further the original intent of the Community Development Block Grant program.

Section 3:
3.FindingsCongress finds the following:(1)The United States has a shortage of millions of homes, contributing to a record number of cost-burdened households across rural, urban, and suburban communities.(2)The housing shortage is constraining the economy and costing the people of the United States about $2,000,000,000,000 per year in lost opportunities and lower productivity.(3)Zoning and land use policy reforms are one part of the solution to addressing the rising cost of housing, alongside policies that invest in fair and affordable housing throughout the United States.(4)The Department of Housing and Urban Development should maintain adequate staffing levels to implement this legislation, assist communities in overcoming zoning and land use challenges unduly constraining housing, and support quality and affordable housing programs serving the most vulnerable in the United States.
