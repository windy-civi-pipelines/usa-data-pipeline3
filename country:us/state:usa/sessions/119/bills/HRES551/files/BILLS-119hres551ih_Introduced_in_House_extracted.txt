IV119th CONGRESS1st SessionH. RES. 551IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESJune 26, 2025Mr. Luttrell (for himself and Mr. Correa) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Oversight and Government ReformRESOLUTIONExpressing support for the designation of National Stop SuiSilence Day. 
Whereas two congressional resolutions, S. Res. 84 and H. Res. 212 of the 105th Congress, have recognized suicide as a national problem and suicide prevention as a national priority;  Whereas, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs, suicide is a leading cause of death in the military community;
         

 Whereas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, suicide ranks among the leading causes of death in the United States, with over 45,000 lives lost each year;
         

 Whereas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, each of these deaths leaves behind an estimated 135 people who are profoundly affected by the death, including family members, friends, and colleagues;
         

 Whereas, according to a report published by the Department of Veterans Affairs in 2016, which analyzed 55,000,000 veterans’ records from 1979 to 2014, an average of 20 veterans die from suicide per day, and a more recent report showed, using age-adjusted statistics, that 17 to 18 veterans die from suicide per day;
         
Whereas a study released by America’s Warrior Partnership in 2022 found that as many as 44 veterans die on average per day from suicide when accounting for overlooked causes of death that are aligned with suicidal and self-harm behavior, which is 2.4 times greater than the official estimate according to reports in the Military Times;  Whereas, according to a 2024 report issued by the Department of Health and Human Services, 1 death by suicide occurs every 11 minutes;
         

 Whereas, according to the National Institutes of Health, learning about behaviors that may be a sign that someone is thinking about suicide, and knowing the warning signs for suicide and how to get help, can help save lives;
         

 Whereas, according to the National Institutes of Health, talking about wanting to die, showing great guilt or shame, and talking about being a burden to others are key indicators that someone is at risk for suicide;
         

 Whereas, according to the National Institutes of Health, feeling empty, hopeless, trapped, extremely sad, more anxious, agitated, full of rage, and having no reason to live due to unbearable emotional or physical pain are key indicators that someone is at risk for suicide;
         

 Whereas, according to the National Institutes of Health, exhibiting changes in behavior (such as making a plan or researching ways to die, withdrawing from friends, saying goodbye, giving away important items, making a will, taking dangerous risks such as driving extremely fast, displaying extreme mood swings, eating or sleeping more or less, and using drugs or alcohol more often) are key indicators that someone is at risk of completing a suicide;
         

 Whereas, according to the National Institutes of Health, suicide is complicated and tragic but is also often preventable;
         

 Whereas, according to the National Institutes of Health, research suggests that acknowledging and talking about suicide may reduce suicidal thoughts;
         
Whereas feelings of strong connections to individuals, family, community, and social institutions can prevent the completion of a suicide; Whereas one person has the ability to save someone’s life from suicide and can prevent a tragic change in the lives of an estimated 135 people who would otherwise be profoundly affected by the suicide; 
Whereas one community can save innumerable lives from suicide; Whereas acknowledgment of, discussion of, and engagement in the topic of suicide by individuals, communities, and government must be encouraged in order to end the stigma, stop the contagion, and reach a resolution to this public health crisis; and 
Whereas September 25th occurs during Suicide Prevention Month and would be an appropriate date to designate as National Stop SuiSilence Day: Now, therefore, be it That the House of Representatives— 
(1)supports the designation of National Stop SuiSilence Day; (2)recognizes the importance of a National Stop SuiSilence Day, a day dedicated to engaging, educating, and activating individuals, communities, and government on the topic of suicide; and 
(3)regards National Stop SuiSilence Day as a critical step in preventing suicides.
