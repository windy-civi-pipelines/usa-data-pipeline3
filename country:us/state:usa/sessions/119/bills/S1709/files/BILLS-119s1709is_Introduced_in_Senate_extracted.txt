Section 1:
1.Short title; table of contents; findings(a)Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Nurse Staffing Standards for Hospital Patient Safety and Quality Care Act of 2025.(b)Table of contentsThe table of contents for this Act is as follows:Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents; findings.Sec. 2. Minimum direct care registered nurse staffing requirement.Sec. 3. Enforcement of requirements through Federal programs.Sec. 4. Nurse workforce initiative.(c)FindingsCongress finds the following:(1)The Federal Government has a substantial interest in promoting quality care and improving the delivery of health care services to patients in health care facilities in the United States.(2)Recent changes in health care delivery systems that have resulted in higher acuity levels among patients in health care facilities increase the need for improved quality measures in order to protect patient care and reduce the incidence of medical errors.(3)Inadequate and poorly monitored registered nurse staffing practices that result in too few registered nurses providing direct care jeopardize the delivery of quality health care services.(4)Numerous studies have shown that patient outcomes are directly correlated to direct care registered nurse staffing levels, including a 2010 Health Services Research study that concluded that implementation of minimum nurse-to-patient staffing ratios in California has led to improved patient outcomes and nurse retention and a 2014 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality study that concluded increases in nurse staffing and skill mix lead to improved quality and reduced length of stay at no additional cost.(5)Requirements for direct care registered nurse staffing ratios will help address the registered nurse shortage in the United States by aiding in recruitment of new registered nurses and improving retention of registered nurses who are considering leaving direct patient care because of demands created by inadequate staffing.(6)Establishing adequate minimum direct care registered nurse-to-patient ratios that take into account patient acuity measures will improve the delivery of quality health care services and guarantee patient safety.(7)Establishing safe staffing standards for direct care registered nurses is a critical component of assuring that there is adequate hospital staffing at all levels to improve the delivery of quality care and protect patient safety.

Section 2:
2.Minimum direct care registered nurse staffing requirement(a)Minimum direct care registered nurse staffing requirementsThe Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following new title:XXXIVMINIMUM DIRECT CARE REGISTERED NURSE STAFFING REQUIREMENT3401.Minimum nurse staffing requirement(a)Staffing plan(1)In generalA hospital shall implement a staffing plan that—(A)provides adequate, appropriate, and quality delivery of health care services and protects patient safety; and(B)is consistent with the requirements of this title.(2)Effective dates(A)Implementation of staffing planSubject to subparagraph (B), the requirements under paragraph (1) shall take effect on a date to be determined by the Secretary, but not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this title.(B)Application of minimum direct care registered nurse-to-patient ratiosThe requirements under subsection (b) shall take effect as soon as practicable, as determined by the Secretary, but not later than—(i)2 years after the date of enactment of this title; and(ii)in the case of a hospital in a rural area (as defined in section 1886(d)(2)(D) of the Social Security Act), 4 years after the date of enactment of this title.(b)Minimum direct care registered nurse-To-Patient ratios(1)In generalExcept as provided in paragraph (4) and other provisions of this section, a hospital’s staffing plan shall provide that, at all times during each shift within a unit of the hospital, and with a full complement of ancillary and support staff, a direct care registered nurse may be assigned to not more than the following number of patients in that unit:(A)One patient in trauma emergency units.(B)One patient in operating room units, provided that a minimum of 1 additional person serves as a scrub assistant in such unit.(C)Two patients in critical care units, including neonatal intensive care units, emergency critical care and intensive care units, labor and delivery units, coronary care units, acute respiratory care units, postanesthesia units, and burn units.(D)Three patients in emergency room units, pediatrics units, stepdown units, telemetry units, antepartum units, and combined labor, deliver, and postpartum units.(E)Four patients in medical-surgical units, intermediate care nursery units, acute care psychiatric units, and other specialty care units.(F)Five patients in rehabilitation units and skilled nursing units.(G)Six patients in postpartum (3 couplets) units and well-baby nursery units.(2)Similar units with different namesThe Secretary may apply minimum direct care registered nurse-to-patient ratios established in paragraph (1) for a hospital unit referred to in such paragraph to a type of hospital unit not referred to in such paragraph if such type of hospital unit provides a level of care to patients whose needs are similar to the needs of patients cared for in the hospital unit referred to in such paragraph.(3)Application of ratios to hospital nursing practice standards(A)In generalA patient assignment may be included in the calculation of the direct care registered nurse-to-patient ratios required in this subsection only if care is provided by a direct care registered nurse and the provision of care to the particular patient is within that direct care registered nurse’s competence.(B)Demonstration of unit-specific competenceA hospital shall not assign a direct care registered nurse to a hospital unit unless that hospital determines that the direct care registered nurse has demonstrated current competence in providing care in that unit, and has also received orientation to that hospital’s unit sufficient to provide competent care to patients in that unit.(C)Duties of the assigned direct care registered nurseEach patient shall be assigned to a direct care registered nurse who shall directly provide the assessment, planning, supervision, implementation, and evaluation of the nursing care provided to the patient at least every shift and has the responsibility for the provision of care to a particular patient within his or her scope of practice.(D)Nurse administrators and supervisorsA registered nurse who is a nurse administrator, nurse supervisor, nurse manager, charge nurse, case manager, or any other hospital administrator or supervisor, shall not be included in the calculation of the direct care registered nurse-to-patient ratio unless that nurse has a current and active direct patient care assignment and provides direct patient care in compliance with the requirements of this section, including competency requirements.

II119th CONGRESS1st SessionS. 1709IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATESMay 12, 2025Mr. Padilla (for himself, Mr. Merkley, Mr. Markey, and Ms. Warren) introduced the following bill; which was read twice and referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and PensionsA BILLTo amend the Public Health Service Act to establish direct care registered nurse-to-patient staffing ratio requirements in hospitals, and for other purposes.1.Short title; table of contents; findings(a)Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Nurse Staffing Standards for Hospital Patient Safety and Quality Care Act of 2025.(b)Table of contentsThe table of contents for this Act is as follows:Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents; findings.Sec. 2. Minimum direct care registered nurse staffing requirement.Sec. 3. Enforcement of requirements through Federal programs.Sec. 4. Nurse workforce initiative.(c)FindingsCongress finds the following:(1)The Federal Government has a substantial interest in promoting quality care and improving the delivery of health care services to patients in health care facilities in the United States.(2)Recent changes in health care delivery systems that have resulted in higher acuity levels among patients in health care facilities increase the need for improved quality measures in order to protect patient care and reduce the incidence of medical errors.(3)Inadequate and poorly monitored registered nurse staffing practices that result in too few registered nurses providing direct care jeopardize the delivery of quality health care services.(4)Numerous studies have shown that patient outcomes are directly correlated to direct care registered nurse staffing levels, including a 2010 Health Services Research study that concluded that implementation of minimum nurse-to-patient staffing ratios in California has led to improved patient outcomes and nurse retention and a 2014 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality study that concluded increases in nurse staffing and skill mix lead to improved quality and reduced length of stay at no additional cost.(5)Requirements for direct care registered nurse staffing ratios will help address the registered nurse shortage in the United States by aiding in recruitment of new registered nurses and improving retention of registered nurses who are considering leaving direct patient care because of demands created by inadequate staffing.(6)Establishing adequate minimum direct care registered nurse-to-patient ratios that take into account patient acuity measures will improve the delivery of quality health care services and guarantee patient safety.(7)Establishing safe staffing standards for direct care registered nurses is a critical component of assuring that there is adequate hospital staffing at all levels to improve the delivery of quality care and protect patient safety.2.Minimum direct care registered nurse staffing requirement(a)Minimum direct care registered nurse staffing requirementsThe Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following new title:XXXIVMINIMUM DIRECT CARE REGISTERED NURSE STAFFING REQUIREMENT3401.Minimum nurse staffing requirement(a)Staffing plan(1)In generalA hospital shall implement a staffing plan that—(A)provides adequate, appropriate, and quality delivery of health care services and protects patient safety;
