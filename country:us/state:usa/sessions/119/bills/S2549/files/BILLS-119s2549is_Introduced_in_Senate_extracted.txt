                Requirement To provide leave
 Upon the request of an employee, an employer shall provide to the employee a minimum of 2 consecutive hours of paid leave on a day of any Federal election, while polls or sites that facilitate voting-related activity are open, in order to vote, return in person a ballot that was received in the mail, or perform other voting-related activity.

 For each employee taking leave under subsection (a), the employer of such employee may specify the hours during which the employee may take such leave, including by requiring that the employee take the leave during a period designated for early voting instead of on the day of the election, as applicable under State law. Any lunch break or other break period may not be included in the 2-hour period designated for leave, but may be taken consecutively with the 2-hour period described in subsection (a).
            
            
                (c)

                    (2)

                    Considerations
 In assessing a civil penalty under this Act, the Secretary shall give due consideration to the appropriateness of the penalty with respect to the size of the business of the employer being charged, the gravity of the violation, the good faith of the employer, and the history of previous violations.
