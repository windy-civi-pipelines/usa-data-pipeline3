Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Radiation Oncology Case Rate Value Based Program Act of 2025 or the ROCR Value Based Program Act.

Section 2:
2.Findings(a)FindingsCongress finds the following:(1)Radiation therapy is the careful use of various forms of radiation, such as external beam radiation therapy, to treat cancer and other diseases safely and effectively. Radiation oncologists develop radiation treatment plans and coordinate with highly specialized care teams to deliver radiation therapy. Nearly 60 percent of cancer patients will receive radiation therapy during their treatment.(2)In 2021, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services reported approximately $4,200,000,000 in total spending for radiation oncology services between the Medicare physician fee schedule and hospital outpatient departments.(3)The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has historically faced challenges in determining accurate pricing for services that involve costly capital equipment, resulting in fluctuating payment rates under the Medicare physician fee schedules for services involving external beam radiation therapy. Additionally, the Medicare physician fee schedule has inadequately recognized the professional expertise physicians and nonphysician professionals need to deliver radiation therapy.(4)The current payment systems incentivize greater volumes of care while bundled payments incentivize patient centered, efficient, and high value care.(5)In 2017, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services recognized that the Medicare payment systems were not adequately addressing radiation oncology services, and the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation released a congressionally requested report on the pursuit of an alternative payment model for radiation oncology (referred to in this section as the Radiation Oncology Model) that addresses the issues in the Medicare physician fee schedule and the Medicare hospital outpatient prospective payment system payment methods.(6)Concerns regarding the proposed Radiation Oncology Model included the significant payment reductions proposed in the model that would jeopardize access to high-quality radiation therapy services and the onerous reporting requirements for participating providers. The Radiation Oncology Model saw indefinite implementation delays.(7)It is necessary, therefore, to create a payment program for radiation oncology services that appropriately recognizes the value of quality radiation oncology services through its financial incentives while containing costs and providing patient-centered care.

I119th CONGRESS1st SessionH. R. 2120IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESMarch 14, 2025Mr. Fitzpatrick (for himself, Mr. Panetta, Mr. Joyce of Pennsylvania, and Mr. Tonko) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committee on Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concernedA BILLTo amend Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to create a Radiation Oncology Case Rate Value Based Payment Program exempt from budget neutrality adjustment requirements, and to amend section 1128A of title XI of the Social Security Act to create a new statutory exception for the provision of free or discounted transportation for radiation oncology patients to receive radiation therapy services.1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Radiation Oncology Case Rate Value Based Program Act of 2025 or the ROCR Value Based Program Act.2.Findings(a)FindingsCongress finds the following:(1)Radiation therapy is the careful use of various forms of radiation, such as external beam radiation therapy, to treat cancer and other diseases safely and effectively. Radiation oncologists develop radiation treatment plans and coordinate with highly specialized care teams to deliver radiation therapy. Nearly 60 percent of cancer patients will receive radiation therapy during their treatment.(2)In 2021, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services reported approximately $4,200,000,000 in total spending for radiation oncology services between the Medicare physician fee schedule and hospital outpatient departments.(3)The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has historically faced challenges in determining accurate pricing for services that involve costly capital equipment, resulting in fluctuating payment rates under the Medicare physician fee schedules for services involving external beam radiation therapy. Additionally, the Medicare physician fee schedule has inadequately recognized the professional expertise physicians and nonphysician professionals need to deliver radiation therapy.(4)The current payment systems incentivize greater volumes of care while bundled payments incentivize patient centered, efficient, and high value care.(5)In 2017, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services recognized that the Medicare payment systems were not adequately addressing radiation oncology services, and the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation released a congressionally requested report on the pursuit of an alternative payment model for radiation oncology (referred to in this section as the Radiation Oncology Model) that addresses the issues in the Medicare physician fee schedule and the Medicare hospital outpatient prospective payment system payment methods.(6)Concerns regarding the proposed Radiation Oncology Model included the significant payment reductions proposed in the model that would jeopardize access to high-quality radiation therapy services and the onerous reporting requirements for participating providers. The Radiation Oncology Model saw indefinite implementation delays.(7)It is necessary, therefore, to create a payment program for radiation oncology services that appropriately recognizes the value of quality radiation oncology services through its financial incentives while containing costs and providing patient-centered care.3.Radiation oncology case rate value based payment program(a)In generalTitle XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:1899C.Radiation oncology case rate value based payment program(a)Establishment(1)In generalNot later than 1 year after the date of enactment of the ROCR Value Based Program Act, the Secretary shall promulgate regulations, using the procedures described in paragraph (5), establishing a Radiation Oncology Case Rate Value Based Payment Program (referred to in this section as the ROCR Program) under which per episode payments are provided to radiation therapy providers or radiation therapy suppliers for covered treatment furnished to a covered individual during an episode of care (as such terms are defined in subsection (j)) in accordance with this section.(2)Maintaining payment rates during period prior to effective date of regulationsThe Secretary shall not reduce the established payment rates for radiation therapy services under the physician fee schedule under section 1848 or the hospital outpatient prospective payment system under section 1833(t) during the time period beginning on the date of enactment of the ROCR Value Based Program Act and ending on the date that the regulations issued by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (1) become effective.(3)ROCR Program goalsThe ROCR Program shall seek to—(A)create stable, unified payments for radiation therapy services under this title;(B)reduce disparities in radiation therapy care for Medicare beneficiaries by increasing access to radiation therapy services close to the homes of beneficiaries;(C)enhance quality of radiation therapy care through practice accreditation and shorter courses of treatment, when appropriate; (D)leverage and encourage the utilization of state-of-the-art technology to improve care and outcomes; and(E)protect Medicare resources by achieving reasonable spending reductions in Medicare for radiation therapy services. (4)PaymentsUnder this section, with respect to covered treatment furnished to covered individuals, payments shall include—(A)per episode payments, as described in subsection (b), to radiation therapy providers or radiation therapy suppliers of radiation therapy services which meet such requirements as the Secretary shall establish by regulation; and (B)the health equity achievement in radiation therapy add-on payment described in subsection (g).(5)Notice and comment rulemakingThe Secretary shall promulgate the regulations described in paragraph (1) in accordance with section 553 of title 5, United States Code, and issue an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking and notice of proposed rulemaking with a comment period of not less than 60 days for each.(b)Per episode payments(1)In general(A)PaymentsThe Secretary shall pay to a radiation therapy provider or radiation therapy supplier an amount equal to 80 percent of the per episode payment amount determined under paragraph 3 (referred to in this section as the per episode payment amount) for each covered individual furnished covered treatment for an included cancer type to cover all professional and technical services furnished during such treatment by the radiation therapy provider or radiation therapy supplier during an episode of care (as defined in subsection (j)).
