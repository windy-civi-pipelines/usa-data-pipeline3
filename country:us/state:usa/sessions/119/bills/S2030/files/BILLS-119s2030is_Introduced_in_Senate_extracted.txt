            Authorization for integration of nacelle improvements into CMV–22
                aircraft
            
                (a)
                Authority
 The Secretary of the Navy may incorporate nacelle improvements into the CMV–22 aircraft fleet as part of a readiness and reliability enhancement initiative.
            
            
                (b)
                Objectives

                    (1)
 enhance mission readiness and reliability of CMV–22 aircraft to meet the operational demands of distributed maritime operations and contested logistics in the Indo-Pacific;
                
                
                    (2)
 build upon the proven performance of nacelle improvement integration in the CV–22 aircraft fleet, which has demonstrated substantial increases in aircraft availability and reductions in maintenance man-hours; and
                
                
                    (3)
 sustain the Nation’s only tiltrotor industrial base, including the retention of skilled workers in Amarillo, Texas, during the transition between the conclusion of V–22 aircraft production and the ramp-up of the future long range assault aircraft program.
                
            
            
                (c)
                Implementation
 The Secretary of the Navy shall—  (1) prioritize incorporation of nacelle improvement kits into CMV–22 aircraft produced or maintained in fiscal years 2025 and 2026;
                
                
                    (2)
 leverage existing installation expertise and performance data from CV–22 aircraft upgrades; and
                
                
                    (3)
 coordinate closely with the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment to preserve key supply chain capabilities and minimize risk during the transition from V–22 aircraft to future long range assault aircraft.
                
            
            
                (d)

                (1)
 the status and schedule for nacelle improvement kit integration into the CMV–22 aircraft fleet;
            
            
                (2)
 observed readiness and performance metrics compared to baseline aircraft; and
            
            
                (3)
 the impact on the workforce and production capability of the tiltrotor industrial base.
