Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Maternal and Infant Syphilis Prevention Act.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following:(1)In 2023, there were 209,253 cases of syphilis in the United States, the highest number since 1950. This represents an 80 percent increase since 2018 and continuing a decades-long upward trend.(2)Untreated, syphilis can seriously damage the heart and brain and can cause blindness, deafness, and paralysis.(3)The increased rise in syphilis cases is causing the rise in congenital syphilis with more than 3,882, a 3 percent increase from 2022, resulting in 252 stillbirths and 27 infant deaths. The cases are more than 10 times the number diagnosed in 2012.(4)When transmitted during pregnancy, congenital syphilis can cause miscarriage, lifelong medical issues, and infant death. Congenital syphilis can present health issues for babies at birth, including neonatal death, meningitis, anemia, and problems with the spleen and liver. If not treated, congenital syphilis can cause bone and joint problems, vision and hearing problems, issues with the nervous system, and developmental delays.(5)High incidence rates of congenital syphilis are often due to lack of timely testing or inadequate treatment during pregnancy. Timely syphilis testing and treatment during pregnancy might be able to prevent almost 90 percent of congenital syphilis cases.(6)Requirements for syphilis screening among pregnant women varies by State. The majority of States require syphilis screening in the first visit, significantly less States require syphilis screenings during the third trimester or at delivery.(7)Screening during the third trimester and at delivery can lead to earlier detection of congenital syphilis and prevent adverse health outcomes for mothers and newborn infants.(8)Increased awareness and education are critical in reducing syphilis among pregnant women to prevent congenital syphilis.
