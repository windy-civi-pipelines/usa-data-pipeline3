Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Northern Border Security and Staffing Reform Act.

Section 2:
2.Findings and sense of Congress (a)FindingsCongress finds the following: 
(1)Between 2002 and 2011, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) roughly doubled their staffing levels, and according to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Office Workload Staffing Model that calculates the number of CBP officers estimated to carry out the CBP mission at each air, sea, and land port of entry in the United States, states that the current staffing gap between the model results and the current staffing levels indicates a nationwide staffing shortage of 5,800 CBP officers. (2)The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 (Public Law 110–161) made Customs and Border Protection Officers eligible for the 1.7 percent enhanced law enforcement officer (LEO) retirement system, which allows law enforcement officers to retire at age 50 with 20 years of service, or at any age with 25 years of service. 
(3)On April 30, 2024, then-Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Commissioner Troy A. Miller testified before the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives that ports of entry face a 400 percent increase in retirements in 2028. (4)This retirement surge would disproportionately affect ports of entry along the northern border. 
(5)A 400 percent retirement surge would leave ports of entry along the northern border understaffed and unable to protect the American people from threats. (6)Ports of entry along the northern border face unique staffing challenges due to their harsh winters, isolated locations, limited economic opportunities, and scarce housing markets. These factors make it difficult for northern ports of entry to recruit and retain officers who are not from its region. 
(b)Sense of CongressIt is the sense of Congress that U.S. Customs and Border Protection must begin a hiring surge of qualified recruits at ports of entry along the northern border to avoid the disastrous effects of the impending retirement surge, future retirement surges, and current staffing shortage.
