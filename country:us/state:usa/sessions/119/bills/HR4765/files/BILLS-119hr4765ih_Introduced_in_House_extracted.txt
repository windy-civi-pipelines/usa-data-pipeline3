Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Securing our Border Act.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following:
(1)United States border security is paramount to the general welfare of our Nation and ensures the efficient and meaningful flow of goods and individuals through legal means. (2)During 2023, an estimated 105,007 drug overdose deaths occurred in the United States.
(3)Only 2 percent of passenger vehicles and 20 percent of commercial vehicles crossing the southern border are scanned by nonintrusive inspection technology through a radiation portal monitor. (4)During fiscal year 2023, U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents processed more than 1,081,030 passengers and pedestrians.
(5)Limiting the amount of deadly illicit narcotics, including fentanyl, from entering the United States would reduce the number of Americans who die annually from the use of such narcotics. (6)Because of the failure to update nonintrusive inspection technologies at land ports of entry along the southern border of the United States, there has been an increase in the amount of illicit narcotics, such as fentanyl, being trafficked across the southern border.
(7)The amount of illicit drugs seized by U.S. Customs and Border Protection along the southwest border was approximately— (A)241,000 pounds during fiscal year 2023; and
(B)275,000 pounds during fiscal year 2024. (8)U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents had 2,135,005 encounters along the southern border during fiscal year 2024, including—
(A)1,218,880 single adults; (B)804,456 family units; and
(C)109,998 unaccompanied minors. (9)According to the Department of Homeland Security, 750 migrants died attempting to cross the southern border during fiscal year 2022, which is—
(A)more migrant deaths than occurred in any previous fiscal year; and (B)more than 200 more migrant deaths than the number of such deaths during fiscal year 2021.
(10)As of September 30, 2024, the immigration court backlog was 3,558,995 cases. (11)Since the end of fiscal year 2019, U.S. Customs and Border Protection has reported 2,371 encounters with potential terrorists at ports of entry along the southern and northern borders.
(12)According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection onboard staffing data, approximately 2,700 additional U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers need to be stationed at United States ports of entry to fully staff such ports. (13)Due to shifting priorities, construction delays, a lack of available technology solutions, and funding constraints, most southern U.S. Border Patrol sectors still rely on obsolete systems or technologies.
