 Whereas, for millions of Indian-Americans, Diwali (or Deepavali) is a time for thanksgiving and prayer for health, knowledge, and peace;
         
Whereas Diwali, a festival of great significance to Indian-Americans, is celebrated annually by Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, and others throughout the United States; Whereas Diwali is a festival of lights, during which celebrants light small oil lamps, place them around the home, and pray for health, knowledge, and peace; 
Whereas celebrants of Diwali believe that the rows of lamps symbolize the light within the individual that rids the soul of the darkness of ignorance; Whereas Diwali falls on the last day of the last month in the lunar calendar and is celebrated as a day of thanksgiving and the beginning of the New Year for many Hindus; 

 Whereas, for Hindus, Diwali is a celebration of the belief that light triumphs over darkness, and good triumphs over evil;
         

 Whereas, for Sikhs, Diwali is feted as the day on which the sixth founding Sikh guru, Guru Hargobind, was released from captivity by the Mughal Emperor Jehangir;
         

 Whereas, for Jains, Diwali marks the anniversary of the attainment of Nirvana by Lord Mahavira, the last of the Tirthankaras (founders of the Jain philosophy); and
         
Whereas Diwali is a celebration of great importance in Indian-American communities throughout the United States: Now, therefore, be it That the House of Representatives—
(1)recognizes the historical and religious significance of Diwali; (2)in observance of Diwali, the festival of lights, expresses its deepest respect for Indian-Americans and the Indian diaspora throughout the world on this significant occasion;
(3)recognizes and appreciates the religious diversity in both India and the United States and throughout the world; and (4)acknowledges and supports the relationship of collaboration and respect between the United States and India.
