 determines that the covered regulation has a net deregulatory effect; and
                        
                        
                            (ii)
 notifies the Director of the Office of Management and Budget of that determination.

                    (1)
                    In general
 The head of a covered agency may only extend an expiration date imposed pursuant to subsection (a)—
                    
                        (A)
 to a date that is not more than 5 years after the current expiration date; and
                    
                    
                        (B)
 if, before the current expiration date and except as provided in paragraph (2)(A)—
                        
                            (i)
 the head of the covered agency provides an opportunity for public comment on the costs and benefits of the applicable covered regulation, which may include the publication of a request for information with respect to the covered regulation; and
                        
                        
                            (ii)
 following the completion of the opportunity for public comment under clause (i), the head of the covered agency determines, based on the comments provided in that opportunity, that an extension of the covered regulation is warranted.
                        
                    
                
                
                    (2)
                    Effect of amendments
                    
                        (A)
                        Deregulatory amendments
 If the head of a covered agency determines that an amendment to a covered regulation of that covered agency has a net deregulatory effect, the amendment may extend the expiration date for that covered regulation without carrying out the requirements of subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1), subject to the limitation described in subparagraph (A) of that paragraph.
                    
                    
                        (B)
                        Other amendments
 If the head of a covered agency does not make the determination described in subparagraph (A) with respect to an amendment to a covered regulation of that covered agency, the existing expiration date of the covered regulation being amended shall apply to that amendment unless the requirements described in paragraph (1)(B) have been met.
                    
                
                
                    (3)
                    Continued extensions
 The head of a covered agency may extend the expiration date of a covered regulation as many times as the head of the agency determines appropriate, subject to the condition that each extension meets the requirements of this subsection.
                
                
                    (4)
                    Savings provision
 Seeking public comment with respect to a covered regulation under paragraph (1)(B)(i), including through a request for information, shall not automatically extend the applicable expiration date of the covered regulation.
                
            
            
                (c)
                Effect of sunset
 If the expiration date of a covered regulation is not extended in accordance with subsection (b)—
                
                    (1)
 the covered regulation shall cease to have any effect as of that expiration date;
                
                
                    (2)
 the applicable covered agency shall not enforce the covered regulation on or after that expiration date; and
                
                
                    (3)
 as soon as practicable after that expiration date, the head of the applicable covered agency shall remove the covered regulation from the Code of Federal Regulations.
                
            
        
        
            4.
            Severability
 If any provision of this Act or the application of such provision to any person or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional, the remainder of this Act, and the application of the provision to any other person or circumstance, shall not be affected.
        
        
            5.
