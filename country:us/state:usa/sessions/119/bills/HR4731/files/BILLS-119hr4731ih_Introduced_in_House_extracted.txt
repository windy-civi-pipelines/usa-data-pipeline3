(1)in paragraph (4)(F)(i), by striking paragraphs (7), (8), (9), and (10) and inserting paragraphs (7), (8), (9), (10), and (11); (2)in paragraph (4)(H)(i), by striking paragraphs (7), (8), (9), and (10) and inserting paragraphs (7), (8), (9), (10), and (11);

(11)Distribution of additional residency positions 
(A)Additional residency positions 
(i)In generalFor each of fiscal years 2026 through 2032 (and succeeding fiscal years if the Secretary determines that there are additional residency positions available to distribute under clause (iv)(II)), the Secretary shall, subject to clause (ii) and subparagraph (D), increase the otherwise applicable resident limit for each qualifying hospital (as defined in subparagraph (H)) that submits a timely application under this subparagraph by such number as the Secretary may approve for portions of cost reporting periods occurring on or after July 1 of the fiscal year of the increase. (ii)Number available for distributionFor each such fiscal year, the Secretary shall determine the total number of additional residency positions available for distribution under clause (i) in accordance with the following: 
(I)Allocation to hospitals already operating over resident limitOne-third of such number shall be available for distribution only to hospitals described in subparagraph (B). (II)Aggregate limitationExcept as provided in clause (iv)(I), the aggregate number of increases in the otherwise applicable resident limit under this subparagraph shall be equal to 2,000 in each such year. 
(iii)Process for distributing positions 
(I)Rounds of applicationsThe Secretary shall initiate 7 separate rounds of applications for an increase under clause (i), 1 round with respect to each of fiscal years 2026 through 2032. (II)Number availableIn each of such rounds, the aggregate number of positions available for distribution in the fiscal year under clause (ii) shall be distributed, plus any additional positions available under clause (iv). 
(III)TimingThe Secretary shall notify hospitals of the number of positions distributed to the hospital under this paragraph as a result of an increase in the otherwise applicable resident limit by January 1 of the fiscal year of the increase. Such increase shall be effective for portions of cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1 of that fiscal year. (iv)Positions not distributed during the fiscal year (I)In generalIf the number of resident full-time equivalent positions distributed under this paragraph in a fiscal year is less than the aggregate number of positions available for distribution in the fiscal year (as described in clause (ii), including after application of this subclause), the difference between such number distributed and such number available for distribution shall be added to the aggregate number of positions available for distribution in the following fiscal year. 
(II)Exception if positions not distributed by end of fiscal year 2032If the aggregate number of positions distributed under this paragraph during the 7-year period of fiscal years 2026 through 2032 is less than 14,000, the Secretary shall, in accordance with the provisions of clause (ii) and subparagraph (E) and the considerations and priority described in subparagraph (C), conduct an application and distribution process in each subsequent fiscal year until such time as the aggregate amount of positions distributed under this paragraph is equal to 14,000. (B)Allocation of distribution for positions to hospitals already operating over resident limit (i)In generalSubject to clauses (ii) and (iii), in the case of a hospital in which the reference resident level of the hospital (as specified in subparagraph (H)(ii)) is greater than the otherwise applicable resident limit, the increase in the otherwise applicable resident limit under subparagraph (A) for a fiscal year described in such subparagraph shall be an amount equal to the product of the total number of additional residency positions available for distribution under subparagraph (A)(ii)(I) for such fiscal year and the quotient of— 
(I)the number of resident positions by which the reference resident level of the hospital exceeds the otherwise applicable resident limit for the hospital; and (II)the number of resident positions by which the reference resident level of all such hospitals with respect to which an application is approved under this paragraph exceeds the otherwise applicable resident limit for such hospitals. 
(ii)RequirementsA hospital described in clause (i)— (I)is not eligible for an increase in the otherwise applicable resident limit under this subparagraph unless the amount by which the reference resident level of the hospital exceeds the otherwise applicable resident limit is not less than 10 and the hospital trains at least 25 percent of the full-time equivalent residents of the hospital in primary care and general surgery (as of the date of enactment of this paragraph); and 
(II)shall continue to train at least 25 percent of the full-time equivalent residents of the hospital in primary care and general surgery for the 5-year period beginning on such date.In the case where the Secretary determines that a hospital described in clause (i) no longer meets the requirement of subclause (II), the Secretary may reduce the otherwise applicable resident limit of the hospital by the amount by which such limit was increased under this subparagraph.  (iii)Clarification regarding eligibility for other additional residency positionsNothing in this subparagraph shall be construed as preventing a hospital described in clause (i) from applying for and receiving additional residency positions under this paragraph that are not reserved for distribution under this subparagraph. 
(C)Distribution of other positionsFor purposes of determining an increase in the otherwise applicable resident limit under subparagraph (A) (other than such an increase described in subparagraph (B)), the following shall apply: (i)Considerations in distributionIn determining for which hospitals such an increase is provided under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall take into account the demonstrated likelihood of the hospital filling the positions made available under this paragraph within the first 5 cost reporting periods beginning after the date the increase would be effective, as determined by the Secretary. 
(ii)Minimum distribution for certain categories of hospitalsWith respect to the aggregate number of such positions available for distribution under this paragraph, the Secretary shall distribute not less than 10 percent of such aggregate number to each of the following categories of hospitals: (I)Hospitals that— 
(aa)are located in a rural area (as defined in subsection (d)(2)(D)), excluding hospitals that are treated as being located in a rural area pursuant to subsection (d)(8)(E);  (bb) are located in an area that has a rural-urban commuting code equal to or greater than 4.0;

(II)any other school listed in section 326(e)(1) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 that establishes a medical college. (D)Prohibition on distribution to hospitals without an increase agreementNo increase in the otherwise applicable resident limit of a hospital may be made under subparagraph (C) unless such hospital agrees to increase the total number of full-time equivalent residency positions under the approved medical residency training program of such hospital by the number of such positions made available by such increase under the subparagraph.

(F)Application of per resident amounts for primary care and nonprimary careWith respect to additional residency positions in a hospital attributable to the increase provided under this paragraph, the approved FTE per resident amounts are deemed to be equal to the hospital per resident amounts for primary care and nonprimary care computed under paragraph (2)(D) for that hospital.
