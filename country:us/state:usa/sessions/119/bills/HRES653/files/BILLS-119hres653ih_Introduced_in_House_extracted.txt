Whereas the United States and Japan share a steadfast commitment to democratic principles including representative Government, respect for human rights, the rule of law, Government accountability, economic freedom, and free civil society; Whereas this shared commitment has served as a cornerstone of the United States-Japan alliance, the cornerstone of peace, prosperity, and stability in the Indo-Pacific region; 
Whereas Japan has demonstrated a commitment to supporting democratic governance and institutions in the Indo-Pacific and worldwide;  Whereas the Japan Center for International Exchange, and its partner organizations, through its Democracy for the Future program, has worked to strengthen Japan’s support for democratic governance;
     
Whereas a multipartisan group of Japanese Diet members has launched the Caucus for Universal Values in the Indo-Pacific on May 15, 2025, to advocate for Japan’s leadership in defending and promoting democratic values across the Indo-Pacific region and beyond; Whereas the Caucus for Universal Values seeks to deepen parliamentary engagement, encourage Government leadership on democracy and human rights, and strengthen partnerships with civil society and international partners, including the United States; 

 Whereas the 109th Congress adopted H. Res. 135, establishing a House Democracy Assistance Commission, eventually renamed the United States House Democracy Partnership, as a bipartisan commission that works directly with legislatures around the world to support the development of effective, independent, and accountable legislative institutions, and whose work aligns closely with the goals of the Japanese parliamentary caucus; and
     
Whereas the United States and Japan, as global champions of democratic governance, face increasing challenges posed by authoritarian influence, democratic backsliding, digital repression, and threats to independent civil society and journalism: Now, therefore, be it That the House of Representatives—
