        Expressing support for the designation of September 2025 as
                Hawaiian History Month to recognize the history, culture and

            responsibility to the Native Hawaiian Community to support their

 Whereas Native Hawaiians are the indigenous people of Hawaii with a rich cultural legacy rooted in centuries of self-sufficiency, land stewardship, innovation, and community-building across the Hawaiian archipelago;
        
        
 Whereas, in the late 19th century, Native Hawaiians were among the most literate people in the world, estimated to have a literacy rate of more than 90 percent, and established the first high school west of the Mississippi River;
        
        
 Whereas pivotal 19th century Native Hawaiian historians and scholars, including Samuel Kamakau, Davida Malo, Kepelino Keauokalani, and John Papa Ii, documented Hawaiian history and produced important literature on Native Hawaiian genealogies, practices, and stories that remains relevant today;
        
        
 Whereas the Kingdom of Hawai'i was an internationally recognized sovereign nation until its unlawful overthrow by United States forces in 1893;
        
        
 Whereas, in 1993, Congress enacted Public Law 103–150 to acknowledge the 100th anniversary of the illegal overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawai'i, and expressed regret for the role of the United States in the overthrow and affirmed the inherent sovereignty of the Native Hawaiian people;
        
        
 Whereas, by 1919, the Native Hawaiian population had significantly declined since Western contact due to disease and loss of culture, language, land, and political leadership;
        
        
 Whereas individual Native Hawaiians have led efforts to revitalize their culture, language, and traditions across generations, including—

 David Kalakaua, the first elected king of the Kingdom of Hawai'i, who commissioned the construction of ‘Iolani Palace as a symbol of Hawaiian innovation and sovereignty and championed Hawaiian traditional arts and culture;

                (3)
 Bernice Pauahi Bishop, a princess of the Kingdom of Hawai'i whose will instructed the establishment of an institution to support the education and cultural stewardship of Native Hawaiian students;
            
            
                (4)
 George Helm, Jr., a musician and activist who, as a founding member of the Protect Kaho'olawe Ohana organization, protested the U.S. military bombing of Kaho'olawe Island and advocated for aloha aina, love for the land;
            
            
                (5)
 Duke Kahanamoku, a swimming champion who won 3 gold medals and 2 silver medals over 3 Olympic games and whose passion for surfing led him to be globally recognized as the father of modern surfing and also remembered for his achievements as a lifeguard, sheriff, and ambassador of aloha;
            
            
                (6)

                (7)

 Whereas Native Hawaiians have made profound contributions to the United States at all levels of the Federal Government and in the Armed Forces including—
            
                (1)
 Prince Jonah Kuhio Kalanianaole, elected as a delegate to the United States House of Representatives from the Territory of Hawai'i and the only royal-born member of Congress;
            
            
                (2)
 Senator Daniel K. Akaka, elected to the United States House of Representatives for 7 consecutive terms until he was appointed to the United States Senate, becoming the first Native Hawaiian to serve as a United States Senator; and

 Whereas Congress, over many decades, enacted hundreds of statutes to promote health, education, housing, and cultural preservation, recognizing and implementing the special political and trust relationship with the Native Hawaiian Community;
        
        
 Whereas the State of Hawaii has enacted legislation formally recognizing September as Hawaiian History Month to honor the legacy of Queen Liliuokalani and promote public awareness for Native Hawaiian history and culture;
        
        
 Whereas, today, there are over 650,000 Native Hawaiians living across the globe, with the highest concentration living in Hawai'i, followed closely by California, Washington State, Nevada, Texas, and Oregon;
        
        
 Whereas Federal law recognizes the continued importance of ancestral homelands for Native Hawaiians and sets aside such lands for them, should they choose to return; and
        
        
 Whereas Hawaiian History Month provides an opportunity to educate all people of the United States about Native Hawaiian history, celebrate their enduring contributions to the United States, and promote reconciliation: Now, therefore, be it
        
    
    
        
 That the Senate expresses support for the designation of Hawaiian History Month—
