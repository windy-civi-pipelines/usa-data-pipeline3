Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Appalachian Communities Health Equity Act of 2025 or the ACHE Act of 2025.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following: 
(1)Communities surrounding mountaintop removal coal mining projects, which involve surface coal mining including blasting with explosives in the steep slope regions of Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia, and Virginia, have raised concerns that pollution of the water, air, and soil that results from mountaintop removal coal mining may be causing health crises in their communities. (2)Peer-reviewed scientific research and reports have raised serious concerns about mountaintop removal mining with respect to elevated risks in categories of birth defects studied, including circulatory, respiratory, central nervous system, musculoskeletal, and gastrointestinal. 
(3)Mountaintop removal coal mining has also been associated with elevated levels of adult hospitalizations for chronic pulmonary disorders and hypertension that are elevated as a function of county-level coal production, as are rates of mortality, lung cancer, and chronic heart, lung, and kidney disease. These health problems strike both women and men in mountaintop removal coal mining communities and these elevated levels of disease, defects, and mortality persist even after controlling for other variables. (4)Scientific evidence, and the level of public concern, warrant immediate action to stop new mountaintop removal coal mining permits and increase environmental and human health monitoring at existing mountaintop removal coal mining projects while the reported links between health effects and mountaintop removal coal mining are investigated by Federal health agencies. 
(5)The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences is uniquely qualified to manage a working group of Federal health agencies with expertise that is relevant to study of the reported links.

Section 3:
3.Health study (a)StudyThe Director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, in consultation with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and the heads of such other Federal agencies as the Director determines appropriate, shall conduct or support a comprehensive study regarding the health impacts, if any, of mountaintop removal coal mining on individuals who reside in communities in close proximity to mountaintop removal coal mining projects. 
(b)ReportThe Director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences shall submit to the Secretary, and make publicly available, a report regarding the results of the study conducted or supported under subsection (a). (c)DeterminationAfter receipt of the report required under subsection (b), the Secretary shall publish on the website of the Department of Health and Human Services a determination regarding whether mountaintop removal coal mining presents any health risks to individuals who reside in communities in close proximity to mountaintop removal coal mining projects.

Section 4:
4.Mountaintop removal coal mining Federal authorization moratoriumNo Federal authorization may be issued or renewed for any mountaintop removal coal mining project, or for any expansion of such a project, by any of the following individuals before the date on which the Secretary publishes a determination under section 3(c) concluding that mountaintop removal coal mining does not present any health risks to individuals who reside in communities in close proximity to mountaintop removal coal mining projects: (1)The Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, or a State, under section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1344). 
(2)The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, or a State, under section 402 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1342). (3)The Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, or a State, under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (30 U.S.C. 1201 et seq.).

Section 5:

(2)based on the results of the monitoring carried out under paragraph (1)— (A)identify any pollution that occurs as a result of the project; and

(b)Results of monitoring (1)Submission to SecretaryEach person that carries out monitoring under subsection (a)(1) for a mountaintop removal coal mining project shall submit to the Secretary, on a monthly basis, the results of such monitoring. 
(2)Public availabilityNot later than 7 days after the date on which the Secretary receives results under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall make such results publicly available on the website of the Department of Health and Human Services in a searchable database format. (c)EnforcementIf a person that conducts a mountaintop removal coal mining project fails to comply with either subsection (a) or (b) with respect to the project, no Federal authorization may be issued or renewed for the project, or for any expansion of the project, by any of the following individuals: 
(1)The Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, or a State, under section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1344).
