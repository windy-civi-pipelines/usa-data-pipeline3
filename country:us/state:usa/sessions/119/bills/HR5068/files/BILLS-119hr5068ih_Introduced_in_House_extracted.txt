Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act or the MORE Act.

Section 2:
2.FindingsThe Congress finds as follows: 
(1)The communities that have been most harmed by cannabis prohibition are benefiting the least from the legal marijuana marketplace. (2)A legacy of racial and ethnic injustices, compounded by the disproportionate collateral consequences of 80 years of cannabis prohibition enforcement, now limits participation in the industry. 
(3)40 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have adopted laws allowing legal access to cannabis, and 24 States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam have adopted laws legalizing cannabis for adult recreational use. (4)A total of 47 States have reformed their laws pertaining to cannabis despite the Schedule I status of marijuana and its Federal criminalization. 
(5)Legal cannabis sales totaled $20,000,000,000 in 2020 and are projected to reach $40,500,000,000 by 2025. (6)According to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), enforcing cannabis prohibition laws costs taxpayers approximately $3.6 billion a year. 
(7)The continued enforcement of cannabis prohibition laws results in over 200,000 arrests annually, disproportionately impacting people of color who are almost 4 times more likely to be arrested for cannabis possession than their White counterparts, despite equal rates of use across populations. (8)People of color have been historically targeted by discriminatory sentencing practices resulting in Black men receiving drug sentences that are 13.1 percent longer than sentences imposed for White men and Latinos being nearly 6.5 times more likely to receive a Federal sentence for cannabis possession than non-Hispanic Whites. 
(9)In 2013, simple cannabis possession was the fourth most common cause of deportation for any offense and the most common cause of deportation for drug law violations. (10)Fewer than one-fifth of cannabis business owners identify as minorities and only approximately 4 percent are Black. 
(11)Applicants for cannabis licenses are limited by numerous laws, regulations, and exorbitant permit applications, licensing fees, and costs in these States, which can require more than $700,000. (12)Historically disproportionate arrest and conviction rates make it particularly difficult for people of color to enter the legal cannabis marketplace, as most States bar these individuals from participating. 
(13)Federal law severely limits access to loans and capital for cannabis businesses, disproportionately impacting minority small business owners. (14)Some States and municipalities have taken proactive steps to mitigate inequalities in the legal cannabis marketplace and ensure equal participation in the industry.

R. 5068IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESAugust 29, 2025Mr. Nadler (for himself, Ms. Titus, Ms. Omar, Ms. Velázquez, Mr. Lieu, Ms. Norton, Mr. Cohen, Mr. McGarvey, Mr. Correa, Mr. Thanedar, Ms. Balint, Ms. Pingree, Mr. Tonko, Mr. Carbajal, Mr. Smith of Washington, Mr. Doggett, Ms. Jayapal, Ms. Tlaib, Mr. Cleaver, Ms. Wilson of Florida, Ms. Brownley, Ms. DeGette, Mr. Huffman, Ms. Williams of Georgia, Mr. Frost, Mrs. Watson Coleman, Mr. Espaillat, Ms. Kelly of Illinois, Ms. Garcia of Texas, Mr. Pocan, Mr. Carter of Louisiana, Ms. DelBene, Mr. Sherman, Mr. García of Illinois, Mr. David Scott of Georgia, Ms. Crockett, Mr. Casar, Mr. Khanna, Mr. Johnson of Georgia, Mr. Mrvan, and Ms. Castor of Florida) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary, and in addition to the Committees on Energy and Commerce, Agriculture, Education and Workforce, Ways and Means, Small Business, Natural Resources, Oversight and Government Reform, and Transportation and Infrastructure, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concernedA BILLTo decriminalize and deschedule cannabis, to provide for reinvestment in certain persons adversely impacted by the War on Drugs, to provide for expungement of certain cannabis offenses, and for other purposes. 
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act or the MORE Act. 2.FindingsThe Congress finds as follows: 
(1)The communities that have been most harmed by cannabis prohibition are benefiting the least from the legal marijuana marketplace. (2)A legacy of racial and ethnic injustices, compounded by the disproportionate collateral consequences of 80 years of cannabis prohibition enforcement, now limits participation in the industry. 
(3)40 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have adopted laws allowing legal access to cannabis, and 24 States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam have adopted laws legalizing cannabis for adult recreational use. (4)A total of 47 States have reformed their laws pertaining to cannabis despite the Schedule I status of marijuana and its Federal criminalization. 
(5)Legal cannabis sales totaled $20,000,000,000 in 2020 and are projected to reach $40,500,000,000 by 2025. (6)According to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), enforcing cannabis prohibition laws costs taxpayers approximately $3.6 billion a year. 
(7)The continued enforcement of cannabis prohibition laws results in over 200,000 arrests annually, disproportionately impacting people of color who are almost 4 times more likely to be arrested for cannabis possession than their White counterparts, despite equal rates of use across populations. (8)People of color have been historically targeted by discriminatory sentencing practices resulting in Black men receiving drug sentences that are 13.1 percent longer than sentences imposed for White men and Latinos being nearly 6.5 times more likely to receive a Federal sentence for cannabis possession than non-Hispanic Whites. 
(9)In 2013, simple cannabis possession was the fourth most common cause of deportation for any offense and the most common cause of deportation for drug law violations. (10)Fewer than one-fifth of cannabis business owners identify as minorities and only approximately 4 percent are Black. 
(11)Applicants for cannabis licenses are limited by numerous laws, regulations, and exorbitant permit applications, licensing fees, and costs in these States, which can require more than $700,000. (12)Historically disproportionate arrest and conviction rates make it particularly difficult for people of color to enter the legal cannabis marketplace, as most States bar these individuals from participating. 
(13)Federal law severely limits access to loans and capital for cannabis businesses, disproportionately impacting minority small business owners. (14)Some States and municipalities have taken proactive steps to mitigate inequalities in the legal cannabis marketplace and ensure equal participation in the industry. 
3.Decriminalization of cannabis
