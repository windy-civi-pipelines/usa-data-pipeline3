Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Cool Corridors Act of 2025.

Section 2:
2.Findings; purpose (a)FindingsCongress finds the following: 
(1)Extreme heat is a growing public health and infrastructure challenge. (2)Tree canopy and green infrastructure reduce surface and air temperatures, improve safety and usability along transportation corridors, and protect infrastructure from heat-related degradation. 
(3)Communities with limited infrastructure investment often lack sufficient tree cover and face increased exposure to extreme heat and limited transportation access. (4)Federal programs such as the Healthy Streets program and the Urban and Community Forestry Program have demonstrated both high demand and the effectiveness of locally driven, community-scale interventions. 
(5)Locally driven efforts to plant and maintain trees along key walking, biking, and transit corridors are under-resourced, despite proven benefits to heat mitigation, public safety, and community health. (b)PurposeThe purpose of this Act is to— 
(1)promote the deployment of cooling infrastructure along transportation corridors; (2)enhance resilience and safety of transportation systems in the face of extreme heat and improve air quality; 
(3)improve safety, accessibility, and usability for pedestrians, cyclists, and transit users; (4)extend the useful life of infrastructure; and 
(5)prioritize investment in communities facing disproportionate heat and access challenges.

Section 3:

(k)Specifications for tree plantingIf the recipient of a grant under this section uses grant funding for tree planting— (1)such planting shall be done in a manner that does not obstruct traffic views or hinder public safety, as determined by the Secretary; and  
(2)the recipient shall be responsible for tree maintenance, including watering and upkeep, as needed.  (l)ReportingA recipient of a grant under this section shall submit to the Secretary an annual report on— 
(1)temperature reduction and environmental performance metrics; (2)infrastructure resilience improvements;
