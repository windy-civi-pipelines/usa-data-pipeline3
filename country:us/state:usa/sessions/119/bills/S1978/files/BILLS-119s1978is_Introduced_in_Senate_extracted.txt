In considering geographic distribution, the Secretary may give preference to regions with demonstrated strategic relevance to national security missions, including those with newly constructed or expanded Department facilities and intelligence community investments.(c)Objectives of defense technology hubsThe objectives of a defense technology hub under the Program are as follows:(1)To accelerate the research, development, prototyping, and transition to operational use of emerging technologies with military applications, including artificial intelligence, quantum technologies, hypersonics, biotechnology, and advanced manufacturing.(2)To foster partnerships among components of the Department of Defense, private industry, academic institutions, and State and local governments.(3)To address regional defense technology needs while leveraging local expertise, infrastructure, and economic strengths, including proximity to Federal mission partners such as combat support agencies and participation in existing innovation consortia or university-industry alliances.(4)To promote workforce development and training programs to build a skilled pipeline for defense innovation including partnerships with research universities, community colleges, and vocational programs.(5)To enhance the resilience and security of the defense industrial base.(d)Grants(1)Grants authorizedUnder the Program, the Secretary may award grants to defense technology hubs.(2)Use of fundsA defense technology hub receiving a grant under paragraph (1) shall use the amounts of the grant for the following purposes:(A)As seed funding for establishment of the defense technology hub.(B)For research, prototyping, and technology transition projects consistent with the objectives set forth in subsection (c).(C)Administrative and evaluation expenses of the defense technology hub relating activities under the Program.(e)Security and compliance requirements(1)In generalUnder the Program, each defense technology hub shall do the following:(A)Implement cybersecurity measures consistent with Department cybersecurity standards.(B)Ensure all research and technology transfers comply with the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and the Export Administration Regulations (EAR).(C)Prevent participation by foreign entities of concern, as identified by the Secretary in coordination with the heads of the elements of the intelligence community (as defined in section 3 of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3003)) or identified in the Entity List maintained by
