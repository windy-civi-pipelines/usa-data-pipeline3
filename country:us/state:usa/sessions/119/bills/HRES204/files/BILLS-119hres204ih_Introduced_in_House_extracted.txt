IV119th CONGRESS1st SessionH. RES. 204IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESMarch 10, 2025Mr. Crane (for himself, Mr. Biggs of Arizona, Mrs. Biggs of South Carolina, Mr. Brecheen, Mr. Clyde, Mr. Gill of Texas, Mr. Harris of Maryland, Mr. Higgins of Louisiana, Mrs. Miller of Illinois, Mr. Norman, and Mr. Roy) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on EthicsRESOLUTIONRemoving a certain Member from a certain standing committee of the House. 
Whereas the annual State of the Union address is a momentous occasion for the President of the United States to address the Nation;  Whereas the speech is a respectful occasion, conducted within the framework of democratic institutions and traditions;  
Whereas, on March 4, 2025, during the joint session of Congress convened pursuant to House Concurrent Resolution 11, the President, speaking at the invitation of the House of Representatives and the Senate, had his remarks interrupted by the Representative from Texas, Mr. Green;  Whereas Representative Green continued his interruption, despite admonition from nonpartisan staff of the House and from the Speaker; 
Whereas Representative Green was removed from the joint session by the Sergeant at Arms; Whereas the conduct of Representative Green was a breach of decorum and degraded the proceedings of the joint session, to the discredit of the House; 
Whereas the actions of Representative Green were not only a breach of civility but also an affront to the dignity of the House and Senate, and to the principles of mutual respect that are essential for the functioning of the legislative process; Whereas Representative Green was unrepentant leading up to the vote taken in the House on March 6, 2025, to censure him, stating before his colleagues on the House Floor, Friends, I would do it again and further acknowledging that he spoke out with intentionality; 
Whereas Representative Green heard the Speaker say that he should cease but chose to carry on; Whereas Representative Green led his colleagues in protest of his censure on that date, which further violated the decorum of the House; 
Whereas clause 1 or rule XXIII of the Rules of the House of Representatives provides, A Member, Delegate, Resident Commissioner officer, or employee of the House shall behave at all times in a manner that shall reflect creditably on the House; and Whereas Representative Green should be removed from his committee assignments in light of conduct he has exhibited: Now, therefore, be it  
That the following named Member be, and is hereby, removed from the following standing committee of the House of Representatives: Committee on Financial Services:Mr. Green of Texas.
