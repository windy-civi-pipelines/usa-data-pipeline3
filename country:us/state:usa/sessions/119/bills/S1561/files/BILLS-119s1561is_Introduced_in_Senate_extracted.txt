 (c) Presumption of genuineness In a determination of the validity of a notarization for the purposes of subsection (a), the signature and title of an individual performing a notarization shall be prima facie evidence in any State court or judicial proceeding that the signature is genuine and that the individual holds the designated title.   (d) Conclusive evidence of authority In a determination of the validity of a notarization for the purposes of subsection (a), the signature and title of the following notarial officers of a State shall conclusively establish the authority of the officer to perform the notarization: 
 (1) A notary public of that State.   (2) A judge, clerk, or deputy clerk of a court of that State.    
 7. Electronic and remote notarization not required Nothing in this Act may be construed to require a notary public to perform a notarization—  (1) with respect to an electronic record;  
 (2) for a remotely located individual; or   (3) using a technology that the notary public has not selected.   
 8. Validity of notarizations; rights of aggrieved persons not affected; State laws on the practice of law not affected 
 (a) Validity not affected The failure of a notary public to meet a requirement under section 3 or 4 in the performance of a notarization, or the failure of a notarization to conform to a requirement under section 3 or 4, shall not invalidate or impair the validity or recognition of the notarization.   (b) Rights of aggrieved persons The validity and recognition of a notarization under this Act may not be construed to prevent an aggrieved person from seeking to invalidate a record or transaction that is the subject of a notarization or from seeking other remedies based on State or Federal law other than this Act for any reason not specified in this Act, including on the basis— 
 (1) that a person did not, with present intent to authenticate or adopt a record, execute a signature on the record;   (2) that an individual was incompetent, lacked authority or capacity to authenticate or adopt a record, or did not knowingly and voluntarily authenticate or adopt a record; or  
 (3) of fraud, forgery, mistake, misrepresentation, impersonation, duress, undue influence, or other invalidating cause.    (c) Rule of construction Nothing in this Act may be construed to affect a State law governing, authorizing, or prohibiting the practice of law.   
 9. Exception to preemption 
 (a) In general A State law may modify, limit, or supersede the provisions of section 3, or subsection (a) or (b) of section 4, with respect to State law only if that State law—  (1) either— 
 (A) constitutes an enactment or adoption of the Revised Uniform Law on Notarial Acts, as approved and recommended for enactment in all the States by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in 2018 or the Revised Uniform Law on Notarial Acts, as approved and recommended for enactment in all the States by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in 2021, except that a modification to such Law enacted or adopted by a State shall be preempted to the extent such modification—  (i) is inconsistent with a provision of section 3 or subsection (a) or (b) of section 4, as applicable; or  
 (ii) would not be permitted under subparagraph (B); or    (B) specifies additional or alternative procedures or requirements for the performance of notarizations with respect to electronic records or for remotely located individuals, if those additional or alternative procedures or requirements— 
 (i) are consistent with section 3 and subsections (a) and (b) of section 4; and   (ii) do not accord greater legal effect to the implementation or application of a specific technology or technical specification for performing those notarizations; and    
 (2) requires the retention of an audio and visual recording of the performance of a notarization for a remotely located individual for a period of not less than 5 years after the recording is created.    (b) Rule of construction Nothing in section 5 or 6 may be construed to preclude the recognition of a notarization under applicable State law, regardless of whether such State law is consistent with section 5 or 6.   
 10. Standard of care; special notarial commissions; false advertising 
 (a) State standards of care; authority of State regulatory officials Nothing in this Act may be construed to prevent a State, or a notarial regulatory official of a State, from—  (1) adopting a requirement in this Act as a duty or standard of care under the laws of that State or sanctioning a notary public for breach of such a duty or standard of care;  
 (2) establishing requirements and qualifications for, or denying, refusing to renew, revoking, suspending, or imposing a condition on, a commission or appointment as a notary public;   (3) creating or designating a class or type of commission or appointment, or requiring an endorsement or other authorization to be received by a notary public, as a condition on the authority to perform notarizations with respect to electronic records or for remotely located individuals; or  
 (4) prohibiting a notary public from performing a notarization under section 3 or 4 as a sanction for a breach of duty or standard of care or for official misconduct.    (b) Special commissions or authorizations created by a State; sanction for breach or official misconduct; false advertising A notary public may not perform a notarization under section 3 or 4 if any of the following applies: 
 (1) The notary public’s State has enacted a law that creates or designates a class or type of commission or appointment, or requires an endorsement or other authorization to be received by a notary public, as a condition on the authority to perform notarizations with respect to electronic records or for remotely located individuals, and—  (A) the commission or appointment of the notary public is not of that class or type; or  
 (B) the notary public has not received the endorsement or other authorization.    (2) The notarial regulatory official of the notary public’s State has prohibited the notary public from performing the notarization as a sanction for a breach of duty or standard of care or for official misconduct.  
 (3) 
 (A) The notary public has engaged in false or deceptive advertising.   (B) For the purposes of subparagraph (A), a notary public shall be considered to have engaged in false or deceptive advertising if the notary public (unless the notary public is an attorney licensed to practice law in a State)— 
 (i) uses the term notario or notario publico; or   (ii) states or represents in a record offering commercial notarial services that the notary public is authorized to— 
 (I) assist in drafting legal records, give legal advice, or otherwise practice law;   (II) act as an immigration consultant or an expert on matters pertaining to immigration;  
 (III) represent a person in a judicial or administrative proceeding relating to immigration to the United States, United States citizenship, or related matters; or   (IV) receive compensation for performing any activity described in this subparagraph.    
 (C) For the purposes of a notarization performed by a notary public under section 4 for a remotely located individual, if a record executed by the remotely located individual attests that the notary public disclosed to the individual the prohibitions under this paragraph, and that the notary public did not make any statement or representation in violation of this paragraph, that record shall conclusively establish compliance by the notary public with the requirements of this paragraph, as of the date on which the individual executes that record.      11. Severability If any provision of this Act or the application of such provision to any person or circumstance is held to be invalid or unconstitutional, the remainder of this Act and the application of the provisions thereof to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected by that holding.
