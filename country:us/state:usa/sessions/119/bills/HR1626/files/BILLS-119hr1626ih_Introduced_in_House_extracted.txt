Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Edward J. Dwight, Jr., Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2025.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following:(1)Edward Joseph Dwight, Jr., was born on September 9, 1933, to Georgia Baker Dwight and Edward Dwight, Sr., in Kansas City, Kansas. Ed Senior had been a second baseman and center fielder for the Kansas City Monarchs and played on other all-Black teams from 1924 to 1937. Georgia was a devoted mother who enrolled her son in a Head Start type program at the age of 2 and made sure to expose her children to as much culture as she could.(2)Edward Joseph Dwight, Jr., grew up with a passion for art and airplanes.(3)Edward became the first African-American male to graduate from Bishop Ward Catholic High School in 1951. He then earned an associate degree in engineering in 1953 from Kansas City Junior College. That same year he left to join the Air Force and began flight training.(4)After completing flight training, he served as a military pilot and obtained a degree in aeronautical engineering from Arizona State University. During his career as an officer in the Air Force, Edward served at bases in Texas, Missouri, and Arizona, developing technical manuals and training fellow pilots on various instruments, as he accumulated flight hours.(5)Edward recalled, I was the only Black officer pilot just about every base I was stationed and that even at 5′4″, he got award after award. While in the Air Force, Edward earned his Bachelor of Science in aeronautical engineering from Arizona State University in 1957.(6)Edward flew some of the most advanced aircraft of the era and ultimately accumulated over 9,000 hours of flight time, 2,000 in high-performance jets. His engineering background and extensive training opened the door for him to enter the test pilot school where the most successful trainees become astronauts.(7)Edward was chosen by President John F. Kennedy to enter training as an experimental test pilot. The Kennedy administration knew that a Black astronaut would be an inspiring display of opportunity for African Americans across the country.(8)On November 4, 1961, Edward received a letter inviting him to join the astronaut training program. He followed the advice of his mother and accepted the invitation to take the first steps toward improving diversity and talent in the United States space program by becoming the first African-American astronaut candidate in the United States.(9)Edward went to the Aerospace Research Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base in California to begin training.(10)This was a time of uncertainty where the color of a person’s skin mattered more than his or her skill.(11)The astronaut candidacy of Edward became cover news on Black magazines such as Jet, Ebony, and Sepia.(12)At Edwards Air Force Base, however, Edward experienced prejudice and scorn, as he recounted in his autobiography Soaring on the Wings of a Dream: The Untold Story of America's First Black Astronaut Candidate.(13)Edward completed the experimental test pilot course and entered aerospace research pilot training in preparation for astronaut duties. He successfully completed the course and continued to perform duties as a fully qualified aerospace research pilot.(14)On October 18, 1963, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (referred to in this section as NASA) announced 14 astronauts for Group 3, but Edward did not make the list.(15)While in training, Edward faced obstacles due to his race, which derailed his chance to be the first African American in space. His fight for equality was one of many trailblazing battles happening during the Civil Rights Era.(16)The assassination of President Kennedy, the main sponsor in the White House of Edward and the space journey, led to his voluntary separation from the Air Force.(17)In 1966, Edward resigned from the Air Force as a captain and moved to Denver, Colorado.(18)After the Kennedy assassination, pressure on NASA to fly a Black astronaut waned, and the first African American would not fly in space until Guion Bluford flew with the crew of NASA’s eighth space flight on the Space Shuttle orbiter Challenger in 1983.(19)After successful careers in the Air Force, and as an IBM systems engineer, restauranteur, aviation consultant, real estate, and construction entrepreneur, Edward dedicated the last 43 years solely to his artistic endeavors.(20)In 1974, George Brown, the first African American lieutenant governor of Colorado and a member of the Tuskegee Airmen in World War II, chose Edward to create a bronze bust of him to display in the Colorado State Capitol.(21)Being a neophyte to bronze sculpting, and at the age of 42, Edward enrolled at the University of Denver in the Masters of Fine Arts program. While at the University of Denver, he became proficient in metal casting and managed the foundry at the school while also teaching other students. He received his Master of Fine Arts in 1977.(22)In 1975, while at the University of Denver, Edward received a commission from the Colorado Centennial Commission to create a series of bronzes depicting the contribution of Blacks to the American Frontier West. The series exhibited for several years throughout the United States, gaining widespread acceptance and critical acclaim.(23)In 1979, the National Park Service encouraged Edward to create a bronze series portraying the history and historical roots of jazz. The series was created and entitled Jazz: An American Art Form, which consisted of over 70 bronzes depicting the evolution of jazz from its African origins to the fusion of contemporary music.(24)Since his art career began in 1976, Edward has become one of most prolific and insightful sculptors in the United States.(25)Edward is the recipient of numerable living legends awards from around the country for his achievements in space activities and contributions in art and Black history.(26)On August 5, 2020, in recognition of his accomplishments as a scientist, test pilot, and sculptor, the Space Force inducted him as an honorary member. A permanent display is installed at the Pentagon in honor of these achievements.(27)In a ceremony at the Pentagon, General Jay Raymond, Chief of Space Operations of the Space Force, presented Edward with the Commander’s Public Service Award and inducted him as an honorary member of the Space Force, for his contributions to the United States, space, and history during times of overt racism in the field of science. Astronaut Victor Glover honored Edward by carrying this award with him to the International Space Station during his Crew–1 mission. Despite all that he had to overcome, Edward was an example of excellence, embarking on a nationwide speaking tour encouraging young people to study science, engineering, and math. (28)In 2021, the Minor Planet Center, an organization affiliated with the International Astronomical Union, named an asteroid after Edward. NASA has honored him by sending his sculpture Pioneer Woman to space on Exploration Flight Test–1 in 2014.(29)On November 3, 2022, Denver International Airport opened an exhibit titled Soaring on the Wings of a Dream, the title of Edward's book. The exhibit is on the life of Edward, beginning with childhood and ending with adulthood. It will be on display for 5 months.
