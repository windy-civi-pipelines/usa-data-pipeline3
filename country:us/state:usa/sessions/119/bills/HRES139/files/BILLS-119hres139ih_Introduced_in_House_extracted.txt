We are ready to do so if the question arises.;Whereas, on January 23, 2025, the Director General of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, said that Iran has increased production of 60 percent enriched uranium from 7 kilograms to over 30 kilograms per month, and currently possess about 200 kilograms, which if enriched to 90 percent would amount to at least 5 nuclear weapons; andWhereas, under UNSCR 2231, the resolution, including the snapback mechanism, terminates 10 years after Adoption Day for the JCPOA, which will be October 18, 2025: Now, therefore, be it That the House of Representatives—(1)recognizes that Iran’s possession of a nuclear weapon would threaten not only the security of the United States, but global security at large, including United States allies and partners in Europe and the Middle East;(2)condemns the Government of Iran’s flagrant and repeated violations of commitments it made under the JCPOA and its international obligations under UNSCR 2231;(3)condemns the Russian Federation and the People’s Republic of China, who remain participants in the JCPOA, for their role in supporting Iran’s malign activities;(4)reaffirms that the United States Government maintains the right to take any necessary measures to prevent the Government of Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons; (5)supports the imposition and enforcement of robust sanctions on Iran for it nuclear and missile programs and on entities and individuals involved in these programs to deter further proliferation efforts; and(6)urges the E3 to invoke the snapback of United Nations sanctions against Iran under UNSCR 2231 as soon as possible before the option expires on October 18, 2025.
