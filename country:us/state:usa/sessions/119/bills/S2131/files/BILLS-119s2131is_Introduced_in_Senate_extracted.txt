Section 1:
1.
            Short title
 This Act may be cited as the Dads Matter Act of 2025.

Section 2:
2.
            Findings
 Congress finds the following:  (1) Father engagement can play an important role in improving maternal health care, addressing maternal mortality and morbidity, and bettering the development and long-term growth of the child.
            
            
                (2)
 The participation of fathers during prenatal care appointments provides the mother with additional support to recognize potential pregnancy-related complications that could lead to maternal mortality and morbidity.
            
            
                (3)
 When fathers are involved during pregnancy appointments and milestones, mothers are 1.5 times more likely to receive prenatal care in the first trimester, which improves health outcomes for both the mother and baby.
            
            
                (4)
 Father support during pregnancy can help promote behavioral health of the mother.
            
            
                (5)
 Father engagement reduces the risks of postpartum mood and anxiety disorders and contributes to a lower likelihood of preterm birth and a healthier birthweight.
            
            
                (6)
 Including fathers in conversations about safe sleep guidelines and sharing guidance about infant crying and the risks of shaken baby syndrome can help reduce infant deaths.
            
            
                (7)
 Active support of the father during breastfeeding greatly increases the chances of successful breastfeeding, which improves the physical and mental health of the baby and the mother.
            
            
                (8)
 Physical contact between the father and the baby just after birth and in the months following birth has been shown to improve the health and development of the baby, improve the mental health of the father, and foster father-child bonding in the short-term and long-term.

            awareness campaign to increase awareness of the importance of father inclusion and

            1.
            Short title
 This Act may be cited as the Dads Matter Act of 2025.
        
        
            2.
            Findings
 Congress finds the following:  (1) Father engagement can play an important role in improving maternal health care, addressing maternal mortality and morbidity, and bettering the development and long-term growth of the child.
            
            
                (2)
 The participation of fathers during prenatal care appointments provides the mother with additional support to recognize potential pregnancy-related complications that could lead to maternal mortality and morbidity.
            
            
                (3)
 When fathers are involved during pregnancy appointments and milestones, mothers are 1.5 times more likely to receive prenatal care in the first trimester, which improves health outcomes for both the mother and baby.
            
            
                (4)
 Father support during pregnancy can help promote behavioral health of the mother.
            
            
                (5)
 Father engagement reduces the risks of postpartum mood and anxiety disorders and contributes to a lower likelihood of preterm birth and a healthier birthweight.
            
            
                (6)
 Including fathers in conversations about safe sleep guidelines and sharing guidance about infant crying and the risks of shaken baby syndrome can help reduce infant deaths.
