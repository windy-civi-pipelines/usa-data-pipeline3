Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Improving Diaper Affordability Act of 2025.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following:(1)Diapers are an essential need for the health and hygiene of babies and toddlers.(2)Families without adequate access to diapers face a higher risk of poor health outcomes for their children, including diaper rash, severe dermatitis, infections, and hospitalization, while also posing a significant risk to maternal mental health.(3)Families with diaper need lack a sufficient supply of diapers to keep a baby or toddler clean, dry, and healthy.(4)46 percent of families with children age 4 or below struggle to provide the diapers their children need; this is an increase from 1 in 3 families expressing diaper need before the COVID–19 pandemic.(5)Low-income families make up 2 out of 3 families with diaper need; a disproportionate amount of these families are Black or Latino.(6)Annually, families spend between $945 and $1,500 on diapers for a child under age 4; a low-income family of 4 spends 2.6 times more of their income on diaper costs compared to a family of 4 making median income.(7)Diaper need affects not only the health and well-being of the child but it can affect the economic security of the entire family, forcing families with diaper need to cut back on food purchases and personal savings.(8)25 percent of parents and caregivers with diaper need reported having to miss work or school because they did not have enough diapers to drop their child off at childcare, and reported missing, on average, 5.1 workdays in the past 30 days; this represents a loss of $296 per month for a parent earning the Federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour.(9)No permanent State or Federal child safety-net program allocates dollars specifically for the purchase of diapers.
