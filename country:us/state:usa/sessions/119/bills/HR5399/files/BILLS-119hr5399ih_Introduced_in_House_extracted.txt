Section 1:
1.Short title
 This Act may be cited as the Equitable Arts Education Enhancement Act.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following: (1)According to a 2021 study by Americans for the Arts, the arts are an invaluable aspect of American society, as they strengthen the economy, improve healthcare, spark creativity and innovation, and unify communities, with 73 percent of participants agreeing that the arts help them to better understand other cultures.
(2)The American Alliance of Museums found that 93 percent of museum directors are white, as are 92.6 percent of board chairs and 89.3 percent of board members, reflecting a clear lack of diversity in the leadership of museums. (3)Minority-serving institutions, or MSIs, are uniquely positioned to produce a diverse generation of art professionals and help bring much needed attention to works by BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color) artists. MSIs have historically served as long-standing conservators and crucial supporters of artist from diverse backgrounds. At a time when diversity, equity, and inclusion are being targeted, the teaching, supporting, and displaying of essential Minority artists who may otherwise have remained unrecognized must be prioritized.
(4)Arts programs and arts departments are expensive and have often fallen victim to funding shortfalls. In 2018, the College Art Association reported that at least 18 institutions of higher education planned to severely curtail or eliminate their arts departments. (5)An increased investment in MSI arts, arts education, and culture programs can further help Black, Indigenous, students of color access an affordable arts education and ensure the continued preparation, conservation, display, and study of works by Minority artists.
