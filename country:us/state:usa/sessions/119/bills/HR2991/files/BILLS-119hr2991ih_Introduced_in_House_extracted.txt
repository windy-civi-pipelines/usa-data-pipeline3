(2)designed to— (A)develop and support partnerships, communications, and shared understanding between the seafood industry and the academic community;
(B)include the seafood industry in research on ocean acidification; (C)deliver research, monitoring, or adaptation results which will benefit both the seafood industry and the academic community;
(D)incorporate into the research agenda the expertise of both the seafood industry, including their unique understanding of the natural environment, and the academic community; (E)promote better understanding of seafood industry research questions and priorities within the academic community;
(F)promote wider understanding of ocean acidification among the academic community, the seafood industry, and other stakeholders as appropriate; and (G)include appropriately balanced support from both the seafood industry and the academic community.

For purposes of this paragraph, the non-Federal share of project costs may be provided by in-kind contributions and other noncash support.
(2)WaiverThe Secretary may waive all or part of the matching requirement under paragraph (1) if the Secretary determines that no reasonable means are available through which applicants can meet the matching requirement and the probable benefit of such project outweighs the public interest in such matching requirement.
