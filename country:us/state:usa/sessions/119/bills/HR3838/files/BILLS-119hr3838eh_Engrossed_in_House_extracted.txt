(2)The expansion of parental leave raises concerns that members who take such leave may receive lower evaluations compared to those who do not. (3)There is currently no provision to exempt members from evaluations due to parental leave, potentially deterring eligible members from taking this leave. 
(4)Each Secretary of a military department has been given authority to implement the leave policies but have not provided explicit guidance on how to characterize such leave for the purposes of evaluations. (5)All Armed Forces have non-rated codes or not observed evaluations to exempt members from evaluations during periods where their performance is not observed, but these do not align across the Armed Forces and do not specifically apply to parental leave. 
(6)Members who are parents face unique hardships, and the 12 weeks of paid family leave for both mothers and fathers, for birth and adoption, is designed to balance the care needs of their children with the demands of their unit.

(1)The Secretaries concerned, acting jointly, shall develop a methodology to assess risks to water management and water security and mission assurance. (2)Such methodology shall include the following: 
(A)An evaluation of all water sources available to a military installation, disaggregated by— (i)raw water (total available water volume); 
(ii)treated potable water; and (iii)treated nonpotable water.

(i)includes an identification of the water usage by tenant commands that reside on the military installation; and (ii)describes the water uses that comprise such total water requirement, disaggregated by— 
(I)drinking water uses; and (II)nonpotable water uses, including industrial and agricultural uses, such as cooling, irrigation groundskeeping, and wash water. 
(D)An evaluation of the age, condition, and jurisdictional control of water infrastructure serving the military installation, including an estimate of the percentage of water lost to such water infrastructure that is in poor or failing condition. (E)An evaluation of the military installation’s water security risks that could negatively impact mission assurance, including— 
(i)the location of the military installation in a drought-prone region; (ii)decreasing water levels or sources; 
(iii)effects of new defense water uses on the total water requirement of the military installation; (iv)increases to the demand for water in areas outside the jurisdiction of the military installation that— 
(I)result from nondefense or defense adjacent requirements; and (II)could affect—

(G)An evaluation of existing water metering and consumption at the military installation, considered at a minimum— (i)by type of installation activity, such as training, maintenance, medical, housing, and grounds maintenance and landscaping; and 
(ii)by fluctuations in consumption, including peak consumption by quarter. (H)The appropriate frequency for reassessment of the installations at highest water security risk.

(F)A cost-benefit analysis of using no dig technologies, including cure-in-place pipe lining, to mitigate infrastructure degradation that leads to water loss. 
(e)Evaluation of installations for nonpotable water reuse 
(1)Each Secretary concerned shall evaluate each military installation under the jurisidiction of the Secretary identified pursuant to subsection (d)(A), to determine the potential for the military installation to mitigate risks to water security through the reuse of nonpotable for nondrinking water uses. (2)Such evaluation shall include the following: 
(A)An evaluation of alternative water sources to offset use of freshwater, including water recycling and harvested rainwater for use as nonpotable water. (B)An assessment of the feasibility of incorporating, when practicable, water-efficient technologies and systems to minimize water consumption and wastewater discharge in buildings located on the military installation scheduled for renovation.

(f)Cost effective landscaping management practices (1)The Secretary concerned shall, to the maximum extent practicable, implement, at each military installation under the jurisdiction of the Secretary, landscaping management practices that mitigate risks to water security and enhance mission assurance by enabling greater quantities of water availability for operational, training, and maintenance requirements. 
(2)For military installations located in arid or semi-arid regions, such landscaping management practices shall include practices that avoid the cost of irrigation. (3)For military installations located in nonarid regions, such landscaping management practices shall include the use of plants common to the region in which the installation is located and native grasses and plants that decrease water consumption requirements.

(2)The expansion of parental leave raises concerns that members who take such leave may receive lower evaluations compared to those who do not. (3)There is currently no provision to exempt members from evaluations due to parental leave, potentially deterring eligible members from taking this leave. 
(4)Each Secretary of a military department has been given authority to implement the leave policies but have not provided explicit guidance on how to characterize such leave for the purposes of evaluations. (5)All Armed Forces have non-rated codes or not observed evaluations to exempt members from evaluations during periods where their performance is not observed, but these do not align across the Armed Forces and do not specifically apply to parental leave. 
(6)Members who are parents face unique hardships, and the 12 weeks of paid family leave for both mothers and fathers, for birth and adoption, is designed to balance the care needs of their children with the demands of their unit. (7)Excessive paperwork required to extend the use of the 12 weeks of military family leave beyond one year additionally burdens members and decreases flexibility. 
(b)RequirementsNot later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this section, the Secretary of Defense shall— (1)prescribe regulations— 
(A)that exempt a member of the Armed Forces who is taking parental leave, under subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) of section 701(h) of title 10, United States Code, that exceeds 31 consecutive days, from a performance evaluation; and (B)under subparagraph (B) of such paragraph, to authorize a member to take leave under such section during the two-year period beginning on the birth, adoption, or placement described in such paragraph without having to request a waiver from the Secretary concerned; and
