3.National academy of sciences study of Federal reservation systems for recreational activities on Federal land(a)Study(1)In generalThe Secretaries, acting jointly, shall, not later than 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act, enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences to carry out a study of Federal reservation systems for recreational activities on Federal land.(2)RequirementsIn carrying out the study under paragraph (1), the National Academy of Sciences shall consult with the Secretaries to carry out the following:(A)A review of the history of Federal reservation systems, such as recreation.gov, including a review of—(i)the considerations, including data, that led to the establishment of the applicable Federal reservation system;(ii)the iterations of the applicable Federal reservation system over time to meet the needs of the applicable Federal agency;(iii)any visitor feedback provided with respect to the applicable Federal reservation system; and(iv)scientific literature or studies examining the efficacy of Federal reservation systems, including user preferences with respect to Federal reservation system design and implementation. (B)Based on available data and existing research, answer the following questions:(i)What are the benefits and challenges of implementing Federal reservation systems to achieve management goals for Federal land, including resource protection, enjoyable visitor experiences, and sustainable operations and facility use?(ii)What data are available, and what additional data are needed, to understand demand for recreation on Federal land? How can the data be used to balance visitor management and conservation goals?(iii)What information is available regarding Federal land users and Federal reservation system users? What information is available or needs to be collected regarding demographics and characteristics of successful and unsuccessful applicants using the Federal reservation systems?(iv)Do Federal reservation systems pose a barrier for certain communities, including international communities, and user groups to access appropriate recreation opportunities on Federal land?

How can transparency be improved to inform the decision making of users of Federal reservation systems?(ix)How are Federal reservation systems incorporating and adapting to emerging technologies, such as geofencing, bots, or third-party websites monitoring and reselling reservations? Are Federal reservation systems resilient to cyber threats?(x)How can Federal reservation systems be improved to reduce no shows and ensure that recreation sites are being used during periods of high demand? Would an increase in first-come, first-served opportunities increase equitable access to outdoor recreation on Federal land? (b)ReportThe agreement entered into under subsection (a)(1) shall include a requirement that, not later than 18 months after the date on which the agreement is entered into, the National Academy of Sciences shall submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a report that describes the results of the study carried out under that subsection.
