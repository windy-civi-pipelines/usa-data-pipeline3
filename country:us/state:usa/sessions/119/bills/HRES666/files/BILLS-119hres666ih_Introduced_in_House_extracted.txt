IV119th CONGRESS1st SessionH. RES. 666IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESAugust 29, 2025Mrs. Trahan (for herself, Ms. Pettersen, and Mr. Fitzpatrick) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and CommerceRESOLUTIONSupporting the goals of Overdose Awareness Day and strengthening efforts to combat the opioid crisis in the United States.
Whereas provisional data from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics indicate there were an estimated 80,391 drug overdose deaths in the United States during 2024; Whereas over 90 percent of drug overdose opioid deaths involved illicitly manufactured fentanyl;
Whereas substance use disorder and drug overdose affect all socioeconomic groups, racial and ethnic groups, geographical regions, and ages; Whereas Black and American Indian or Alaskan Native populations are more likely to die from a drug overdose than their White counterparts;
Whereas substance use disorder is a chronic disease, and recognizing it as such decreases stigma and acknowledges that substance use is a health issue; Whereas overdose deaths are preventable, and countless lives can be saved through increased awareness, effective prevention strategies, timely intervention, comprehensive treatment, and robust recovery support; and
Whereas Congress and the executive branch must continue to work together to pass and implement policy solutions that accelerate and strengthen the United States ability to treat and prevent substance use disorders: Now, therefore, be it That the House of Representatives—
(1)recognizes Overdose Awareness Day in the United States; (2)commits to advancing and passing bipartisan policies that reduce the stigma surrounding substance use disorders and overdoses; and
(3)is dedicated to collaborating with States, localities, businesses, nongovernmental organizations, health care providers, patients, and families to support a comprehensive system that promotes prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and recovery from opioid use disorder.
