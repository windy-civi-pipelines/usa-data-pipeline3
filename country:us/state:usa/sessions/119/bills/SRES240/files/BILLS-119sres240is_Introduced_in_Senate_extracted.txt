 Whereas disability-based discrimination constitutes more than half (53.26 percent) of all housing discrimination complaints filed with fair housing organizations and government agencies;Whereas, for the past several years, disability has continued to be the top basis of discrimination reported under the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq.), representing 5,128 complaints filed with the Department of Housing and Urban Development and its Fair Housing Assistance Program partners in fiscal year 2023;Whereas less than 5 percent of housing nationwide is accessible to individuals with moderate mobility difficulties, and less than 1 percent of housing is accessible for those who use wheelchairs;Whereas approximately 32 percent of adults with disabilities have reported unfair treatment in healthcare settings due to their disabilities or other personal characteristics;Whereas, in 2023, only 22.5 percent of people with disabilities were employed, compared to 65.8 percent of those without disabilities;Whereas students with disabilities frequently receive insufficient support, resulting in lower graduation rates and limited career opportunities;Whereas Black and Latino homebuyers—(1)have been steered toward or away from certain neighborhoods, which impacts their ability to buy homes in their preferred areas;(2)face appraisal discrimination, which diminishes their wealth by undervaluing their property;

Whereas Black, Latino, Asian American, and Indigenous workers are over represented in dangerous jobs with worse pay and fewer benefits due to ongoing occupational segregation;
 Whereas, in 2023, the wage gap widened for the first time in 20 years, with women working full-time, year-round jobs receiving 83 cents for every dollar paid to men while that number was 84 cents in 2022, and Black women experienced a more severe backslide;Whereas, in 2023, Black women working full-time, year-round jobs were paid 66 cents for every dollar paid to White, non-Hispanic men, compared to 69 cents in 2022; Whereas Asian American and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander women were paid 97 cents, Latinas were paid 58 cents, and Native women were paid 58 cents for every dollar paid to White, non-Hispanic men;

 Whereas the persistence of discrimination in the United States limits our innovation and productivity, weakens our economy, and undermines our democracy;Whereas the failure to effectively address growing inequality has decreased economic mobility rates in the United States and made the American Dream more elusive regardless of talent or hard work;Whereas the Federal Government is responsible for addressing discriminatory barriers to opportunity in the United States by increasing and enhancing initiatives that support diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility, and enforcing anti-discrimination laws;Whereas, according to an analysis by Citi Group, disparities for Black people across the economic system of the United States from 2004 to 2024 have cost the United States economy $16,000,000,000,000;Whereas studies show that companies with workforces that are diverse on multiple levels, including by race, are more innovative, productive, and profitable;Whereas diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility initiatives can address disparities and reduce labor shortages in high-demand industries like technology, healthcare, and finance, ensuring that the United States can compete in the global marketplace;Whereas the United States is best served when the Federal workforce reflects the talent and contributions of people from all backgrounds;Whereas career pathway programs, investment in Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges and Universities, and other minority-serving institutions, access to financial aid, expanding access to apprenticeship and job skills training programs, offering mentorship opportunities, and other solutions help talented individuals overcome barriers to opportunity;Whereas diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility initiatives are crucial in ensuring fair and comprehensive access to core services for all communities, whether in education, healthcare, employment, or government programs;Whereas diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility initiatives ensure that core services are designed to meet the diverse needs of all populations, especially historically underserved or marginalized communities;Whereas, without an equity lens, systemic barriers, such as cost, transportation, and a lack of culturally competent services, may prevent some groups from accessing essential resources;Whereas government agencies and organizations that integrate diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility principles develop policies that intentionally reduce disparities in service accessibility;Whereas diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility-focused transportation policies could ensure rural communities and individuals with disabilities have equal access to public transit;Whereas a diverse workforce in service-oriented fields, such as education, healthcare, and social services, leads to better understanding and responsiveness to community needs;Whereas inclusion training can reduce biases that might otherwise result in service denial or discrimination;Whereas qualified students and workers who benefit from scholarships, internships, training programs, and mentorships supported by diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility initiatives could lose these opportunities, potentially widening existing disparities;Whereas diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility initiatives in schools, colleges, and universities help foster inclusive environments and support underrepresented students;Whereas eliminating these initiatives may reduce retention and graduation rates among underrepresented groups;Whereas companies and organizations may struggle to recruit and retain skilled, diverse workforces, which could potentially affect innovation, productivity, and competitiveness;Whereas diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility initiatives bring down costs in several ways through reduced turnover and hiring costs and better decision making;Whereas diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility initiatives help mitigate the risk of discrimination lawsuits by helping to ensure equal opportunity and workplace cultures of respect; Whereas diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility initiatives often support small minority- and women-owned businesses through procurement goals and funding, and their elimination could hinder such businesses' growth and success;

 Whereas the idea that diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility initiatives do not consider merit is a false and harmful narrative that misunderstands both concepts;Whereas, rather than lowering standards, diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility initiatives ensure that merit is measured in ways that are more accurate, inclusive, and aligned with real-world potential, benefitting schools, workplaces, and society at large; Whereas, contrary to the Trump administration's claims, diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility initiatives are not about preferential treatment or quotas but leveling the playing field;
 Whereas dismantling these programs disregards the persistent inequalities that necessitate their existence and signals a troubling departure from the commitment of the United States to civil rights and equal opportunity for all; andWhereas attacks on initiatives that advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility make the United States less prosperous, fair, and safe: Now, therefore, be itThat the Senate—(1)affirms its commitment to—(A)diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility as essential foundations for achieving the American Dream; and(B)fostering environments where all individuals have the freedom to be healthy, prosperous, and safe, the opportunity to realize their full potential, and the right to be equal members of our multiracial democracy; and(2)encourages local, State, and Federal policymakers, educational institutions, workplaces, and other organizations to adopt, uphold, and promote inclusivity, expand diversity and accessibility, remove barriers, and provide equitable opportunities for all individuals to pursue their dreams, which, in turn, benefits all people.
