Veterans enrolled in remote patient monitoring had a 53 percent decrease in VA bed days of care and a 33 percent decrease in VA hospital admissions.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H400D9E68EBEC4FBEBB4799AA4062FE6F"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Providers are currently required by Medicare to collect 16 days of patient data over a 30-day period in order to bill Medicare for remote monitoring services, even in cases where this full duration is not medically necessary to ensure the health and safety of the patient. This can limit the use of remote monitoring in instances where it can promote patient health and safety and where it can reduce the overall cost on the health system.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HC9C4F87338E14C8FA3BB8E17211F60DA"><enum>(4)</enum><text>In the 2021 Physician Fee Schedule, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) issued an interim policy to lower the duration required by Medicare to bill for remote monitoring services from 16 days to 2 days within a 30-day period, but only for individuals who had been diagnosed with, or were suspected of having, COVID–19. This short-term flexibility called attention to the long-term need to reassess the minimum duration required for providers to bill for remote monitoring.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H16BF5F0698FD4574843B3AC09996BC9B"><enum>(5)</enum><text>As part of issuing the 2021 Physician Fee Schedule, CMS studied comments in support of permanently lowering the minimum required duration of remote monitoring for all patients, not just those with COVID–19.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HC65D74824625475A89A5029F031668E2"><enum>(6)</enum><text>CMS concluded that <quote>we agree that a full 16 days of monitoring may not always be reasonable and necessary</quote> but did not revise the 16 day per 30-day period minimum duration for all patients because CMS did not believe they had received <quote>specific clinical examples</quote> to allow for <quote>understanding under what clinical circumstances fewer days of monitoring would be medically reasonable and necessary and allow a practitioner to establish clinically meaningful care</quote>.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H443B9CC582C5429DAC89C4ACDAE6D898"><enum>(7)</enum><text>Clinical evidence shows numerous instances in which fewer than sixteen days of monitoring within a 30-day period establishes clinically meaningful care. These include:</text><subparagraph id="H8536BB4D75774510A8B207BC711B25DF"><enum>(A)</enum><text>Sixteen days of monitoring per 30-day period may not be required to establish that a patient has sleep apnea.</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="H069336E4A5C5465DBC4AC8ABD17AFEA8"><enum>(B)</enum><text>A patient prescribed a narcotic for pain may require their breathing to be monitored only while on the medication.</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="HA0A0ACD76D0A49499850BC16D0562C6D"><enum>(C)</enum><text>A patient with a chronic condition like diabetes, congestive heart failure, or obesity may have their weight monitored over a longer period of time, but it is not clinically appropriate to have such patient step on a scale 16 or more times in each 30-day period.</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="H0E780A9027F04EF1AE54456A2D164FC3"><enum>(D)</enum><text>A patient whose blood pressure or oxygen levels are monitored during physical therapy may not necessitate 16 days of monitoring in each 30-day period given physical therapy is often ordered twice weekly.</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="H2B5589A5A3BF4746B3260F736E4B36B8"><enum>(E)</enum><text>A patient who wears a heart monitor to measure palpitations may wear the monitor continuously, but the data only needs to be collected when the individual is experiencing symptoms.</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="H024654A6960A40A6AF640CE1D13DD12B"><enum>(F)</enum><text>A patient with hypertension is often monitored for long-term management of this condition on more of a weekly basis, only needing more frequent data collection for active monitoring with changes in medication or dosages.</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="HC56B5CACE21B4C1E9D82B51629BB2E8B"><enum>(G)</enum><text>A patient who suffers from Muscular Sclerosis or Muscular Dystrophy may benefit from a provider tracking the patient’s exercise between visits to monitor certain physiologic parameters such as muscle movement but may not produce 16 days of data in a 30-day period.</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="H423636CE7EED4807AB09EC1723E93086"><enum>(H)</enum><text>A patient who needs a total joint replacement may simply need pre-testing for surgery baselines, including to establish gait, force,

patient with urologic dysfunction, male urine flow data obtained from the patient can be collected in two to four consecutive days.</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="H45CFE13F65F54CFD9EC6624B26976C3B"><enum>(J)</enum><text>Remote monitoring may allow a provider to assess a patient’s adherence, range of motion, and response to physical therapy and occupational therapy regimens even though many such regimens are less than 16 days per month.</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="HEBE5081050104969BF39BCA611E962B8"><enum>(K)</enum><text>Monitoring cognitive behavioral therapy for less than 16 days in a 30-day period may provide clinically meaningful care while moderating a patient’s anxiety and other symptoms.</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="HCF4CB7550FC8421AB5183356AC3388D2"><enum>(L)</enum><text>A patient with respiratory issues may not require a full 16 days of monitoring of inhaler usage to get clinical benefits from remote monitoring.</text></subparagraph></paragraph><paragraph id="HFC5A1A3496DD4AC5A7FDB53E9205B979"><enum>(8)</enum><text>A two-day minimum duration would permit Medicare coverage of the full range of remote monitoring services that can be beneficial to a patient without precluding the differential reimbursement of individual remote monitoring services based on patient acuity and cost.</text></paragraph></section><section id="H48AB296DA4FF49FD967B385FADB2D111"><enum>3.</enum><header>Ensuring appropriate access to remote monitoring services furnished under the medicare
