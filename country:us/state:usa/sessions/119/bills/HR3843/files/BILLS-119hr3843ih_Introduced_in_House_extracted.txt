(b)Exemptions (1)Operator or owner petitionNot later than 90 days after the publication of the most recent long-term reliability assessment categorizing the relevant covered area as at high risk or elevated risk of electricity supply shortfalls, an operator or owner of a covered electric generating unit located in such covered area may submit to the Commission a petition for an exemption from a prohibition under subsection (a) with respect to such covered electric generating unit.  
(2)Final determination 
(A)Deadline 
(i)In generalExcept as otherwise provided in this paragraph, not later than 90 days after a petition for an exemption is submitted to the Commission under paragraph (1), the Commission shall issue a final determination granting such exemption or denying the petition for such exemption. (ii)Petitions based on unprofitability or financial lossesSubject to subparagraph (C), with respect to a petition for an exemption under this subsection for a covered electric generating unit that is based on unprofitability or sustained financial losses, if the Commission determines that retirement of, or converting the fuel source for, such covered electric generating unit would hinder the reliable operation of the bulk-power system, the Commission shall, not later than 180 days after such petition is submitted to the Commission under paragraph (1), issue a final determination granting such exemption or denying the petition for such exemption.  
(B)CriteriaSubject to subparagraph (C), the Commission shall issue a final determination granting an exemption under this subsection if the Commission determines— (i)that the applicable operator or owner of a covered electric generating unit has demonstrated in a petition submitted under paragraph (1) of this subsection that compliance with the relevant prohibition under subsection (a) will result in—

(4)DOE grant or loan terms and funding (A)FundsThe Secretary of Energy may use unobligated amounts made available to the Secretary under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Public Law 117–58) or Public Law 117–169 to make grants and loans under paragraph (2)(C)(ii) and subparagraph (D) of this paragraph.  
(B)GrantsThe Secretary of Energy, in consultation with other agencies as the Secretary determines appropriate, may, if the Secretary determines it to be necessary and appropriate, make a grant to an operator or owner of a covered electric generating unit under paragraph (2)(C)(ii) of this subsection in order to provide for the prudent costs for the operation of such covered electric generating unit during any time the prohibition under subsection (a)(1) is in effect with respect to such covered electric generating unit.  (C)Loans (i)Use of loan fundsA loan made under paragraph (2)(C)(ii)— 
(I)shall be made for purposes of— (aa)keeping the relevant covered electric generating unit operating; and
