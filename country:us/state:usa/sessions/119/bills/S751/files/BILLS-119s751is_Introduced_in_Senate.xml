id="id7c82016509cf40158120e91d73616c80"><enum>(1)</enum><text>Throughout United States history, society has used (in conjunction with skin color) hair texture and hairstyle to classify individuals on the basis of race.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="idd1592cce267a421da28d30ee99e08b31"><enum>(2)</enum><text>Like one’s skin color, one’s hair has served as a basis of race and national origin discrimination.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="id1f4e9d2e1b434cd98521c6c4946d479e"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Racial and national origin discrimination can and do occur because of longstanding racial and national origin biases and stereotypes associated with hair texture and style.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="id551dd8631bd04bfebb8b4506390a6469"><enum>(4)</enum><text>For example, people of African descent have been deprived of educational and employment opportunities because they are adorned with natural or protective hairstyles in which hair is tightly coiled or tightly curled, or worn in locs, cornrows, twists, braids, Bantu knots, or Afros.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="id9ef242eff1ba4705b4989e644c84165c"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Racial and national origin discrimination is reflected in school and workplace policies and practices that bar natural or protective hairstyles commonly worn by people of African descent.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="ida7ed3c473bd94b8686f16002619cab16"><enum>(6)</enum><text>For example, as recently as 2018, the United States Armed Forces had grooming policies that barred natural or protective hairstyles that servicewomen of African descent commonly wear and that described these hairstyles as <quote>unkempt</quote>.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="id3727057d4cbf40a698951b3d0bdea965"><enum>(7)</enum><text>In 2018, the United States Armed Forces rescinded these policies and recognized that this description perpetuated derogatory racial stereotypes.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="id46832f3d36be49ecb3761a1d4e96c5bb"><enum>(8)</enum><text>The United States Armed Forces also recognized that prohibitions against natural or protective hairstyles that African-American servicewomen are commonly adorned with are racially discriminatory and bear no relationship to African-American servicewomen’s occupational qualifications and their ability to serve and protect the Nation.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="id2f25aaf9a5a3435881a649d8b27ec87f"><enum>(9)</enum><text>Some Federal courts have narrowly interpreted the protections against discrimination on the basis of race or national origin found in existing Federal civil rights laws, including provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (<external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/42/2000a">42 U.S.C. 2000a et seq.</external-xref>), section 1977 of the Revised Statutes (<external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/42/1981">42 U.S.C. 1981</external-xref>), and the Fair Housing Act (<external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/42/3601">42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq.</external-xref>), thereby permitting, for example, employers to discriminate against people of African descent who wear natural or protective hairstyles, even though the employment policies involved are not related to workers’ ability to perform their jobs. </text></paragraph><paragraph id="id0f3f4d21d05744d688d1beb9803e9549"><enum>(10)</enum><text>Applying these narrow interpretations has resulted in a lack of Federal civil rights protection for individuals who are discriminated against on the basis of characteristics that are commonly associated with race and national origin.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="idb8842b713d3f4ff29c8d93a631a8abb6"><enum>(11)</enum><text>Starting in 2019, State legislatures and municipal bodies throughout the United States have introduced and passed legislation that rejects certain Federal courts’ restrictive interpretation of race and national origin, and expressly classifies race and national origin discrimination as inclusive of discrimination on the basis of natural or protective hairstyles commonly associated with race and national origin.</text></paragraph></subsection><subsection id="id70833a7199744559847321bbcddbd533"><enum>(b)</enum><header>Sense of Congress</header><text>It is the sense of Congress that—</text><paragraph id="id910a03b561e44f02953d547654d31a35"><enum>(1)</enum><text>the Federal Government should acknowledge that individuals who have hair texture or wear a hairstyle that is historically and contemporarily associated with African Americans or persons of African descent have suffered harmful discrimination in schools, workplaces, and other contexts based upon longstanding race and national origin stereotypes and biases;</text></paragraph><paragraph id="id6a54e4e78dc345c58d055678872b6734"><enum>(2)</enum><text>a clear and comprehensive law should address the deprivation of educational, employment, and other opportunities on the basis of hair texture and hairstyle that are commonly associated with race or national origin;</text></paragraph><paragraph

of hair texture and hairstyle; and</text></paragraph><paragraph id="ida6676a2b3602446588e881ea9accb861"><enum>(8)</enum><text>it is necessary to mandate that school, workplace, and other applicable
