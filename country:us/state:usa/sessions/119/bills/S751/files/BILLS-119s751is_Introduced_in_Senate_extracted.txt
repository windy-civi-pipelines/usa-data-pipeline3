Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair Act of 2025 or the CROWN Act of 2025.

Section 2:
2.Findings; sense of Congress; purpose(a)FindingsCongress finds the following:(1)Throughout United States history, society has used (in conjunction with skin color) hair texture and hairstyle to classify individuals on the basis of race.(2)Like one’s skin color, one’s hair has served as a basis of race and national origin discrimination.(3)Racial and national origin discrimination can and do occur because of longstanding racial and national origin biases and stereotypes associated with hair texture and style.(4)For example, people of African descent have been deprived of educational and employment opportunities because they are adorned with natural or protective hairstyles in which hair is tightly coiled or tightly curled, or worn in locs, cornrows, twists, braids, Bantu knots, or Afros.(5)Racial and national origin discrimination is reflected in school and workplace policies and practices that bar natural or protective hairstyles commonly worn by people of African descent.(6)For example, as recently as 2018, the United States Armed Forces had grooming policies that barred natural or protective hairstyles that servicewomen of African descent commonly wear and that described these hairstyles as unkempt.(7)In 2018, the United States Armed Forces rescinded these policies and recognized that this description perpetuated derogatory racial stereotypes.(8)The United States Armed Forces also recognized that prohibitions against natural or protective hairstyles that African-American servicewomen are commonly adorned with are racially discriminatory and bear no relationship to African-American servicewomen’s occupational qualifications and their ability to serve and protect the Nation.(9)Some Federal courts have narrowly interpreted the protections against discrimination on the basis of race or national origin found in existing Federal civil rights laws, including provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000a et seq.), section 1977 of the Revised Statutes (42 U.S.C. 1981), and the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq.), thereby permitting, for example, employers to discriminate against people of African descent who wear natural or protective hairstyles, even though the employment policies involved are not related to workers’ ability to perform their jobs. (10)Applying these narrow interpretations has resulted in a lack of Federal civil rights protection for individuals who are discriminated against on the basis of characteristics that are commonly associated with race and national origin.(11)Starting in 2019, State legislatures and municipal bodies throughout the United States have introduced and passed legislation that rejects certain Federal courts’ restrictive interpretation of race and national origin, and expressly classifies race and national origin discrimination as inclusive of discrimination on the basis of natural or protective hairstyles commonly associated with race and national origin.(b)Sense of CongressIt is the sense of Congress that—(1)the Federal Government should acknowledge that individuals who have hair texture or wear a hairstyle that is historically and contemporarily associated with African Americans or persons of African descent have suffered harmful discrimination in schools, workplaces, and other contexts based upon longstanding race and national origin stereotypes and biases;(2)a clear and comprehensive law should address the deprivation of educational, employment, and other opportunities on the basis of hair texture and hairstyle that are commonly associated with race or national origin;(3)clear, consistent, and enforceable legal standards must be provided to redress the widespread incidences of race and national origin discrimination based upon hair texture and hairstyle in schools, workplaces, housing, federally funded institutions, and other contexts;(4)it is necessary to prevent educational, employment, and other decisions, practices, and policies generated by or reflecting negative biases and stereotypes related to race or national origin;(5)the Federal Government must play a key role in enforcing Federal civil rights laws in a way that secures equal educational, employment, and other opportunities for all individuals regardless of their race or national origin;(6)the Federal Government must play a central role in enforcing the standards established under this Act on behalf of individuals who suffer race or national origin discrimination based upon hair texture and hairstyle;(7)it is necessary to prohibit and provide remedies for the harms suffered as a result of race or national origin discrimination on the basis of hair texture and hairstyle; and(8)it is necessary to mandate that school, workplace, and other applicable standards be applied in a nondiscriminatory manner and to explicitly prohibit the adoption or implementation of grooming requirements that disproportionately impact people of African descent.(c)PurposeThe purpose of this Act is to institute definitions of race and national origin for Federal civil rights laws that effectuate the comprehensive scope of protection Congress intended to be afforded by such laws and Congress’ objective to eliminate race and national origin discrimination in the United States.
