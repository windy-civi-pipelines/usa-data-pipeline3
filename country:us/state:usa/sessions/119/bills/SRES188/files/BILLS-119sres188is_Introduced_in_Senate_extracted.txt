Whereas the Senate recognizes the communities from Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, including the many Hmong, Cham, Cambodian, Iu-Mien, Khmu, Lao, Montagnard, and Vietnamese people who supported and defended the United States Armed Forces during the conflict in Southeast Asia during the 1960s and 1970s;Whereas the Senate remembers the 50th Anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War on April 30, 2025, and the sacrifices of the members of the United States Armed Forces that served in the conflict;Whereas, since the end of the Vietnam War, more than 40,000 people in Vietnam have been killed by unexploded ordnance and 60,000 have been injured;Whereas, since 1979, more than 25,000 people in Laos and 65,000 people in Cambodia have been killed or injured by landmines or unexploded ordnance;
