Jackson Women's Health Organization (597 U.S. 215 (2022)) held that there is no constitutional right to abortion, 19 States have outright banned the procedure or imposed a ban at an arbitrary point in pregnancy. More than 25,000,000 women aged 15 to 44 live in States where there are more restrictions imposed than prior to the Dobbs decision. This is nearly 1 in 5 women.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="id87fab8f792a8478e9d49201f6af92ce4"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Since 1976, the Federal Government has banned the use of Federal funds to pay for abortion services and allows for exceptions only in very narrow circumstances. This ban affects people of reproductive age in the United States who are insured through the Medicaid program, as well as individuals who receive insurance or care through other federally funded health programs and plans.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="ida23942b6fc014709a7bc277a72b07dec"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Women make up the majority of Medicaid enrollees (54 percent), and nearly 2 out of 3 women enrolled in the program are of reproductive age. Due to systematic barriers and discrimination, a disproportionately higher number of women of color and Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, or Queer (LGBTQ) individuals are enrolled in the program.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="idd7f30d4eec0e47339a93b3211ffe8497"><enum>(7)</enum><text>More than 40 percent of youth and children under age 19 and 12 percent of young people aged 19 to 25 get their health insurance through government programs.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="id7b0215abd8e042ab82d93a978842f716"> <enum>(8)</enum> <text>Women of color are more likely to be insured by the Medicaid program.

Nearly 15 percent of Asian American and Pacific Islander women are enrolled in the Medicaid program as of 2019.</text>

The IHS serves a population of approximately 2,560,000 and as a federally funded system, since 1988, it has been barred from providing abortion services except for very limited cases. American Indians and Alaska Natives often face higher levels of poverty and limited access to health care for a number of intersecting oppressions thus leaving them without recourse for the Federal ban on abortion services.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="id0d21b940bc3c40d3aa4c770a5c676359"><enum>(11)</enum><text>As of 2025, 30 States and the District of Columbia apply Hyde-like restrictions and restrict Medicaid from covering abortion procedures except in cases of rape, incest, or the pregnant person’s life is in danger despite allowance for a State’s unmatched funds to provide coverage for abortion. As of 2024, 35 percent, or 5,500,000 women aged 15 to 49 who are enrolled in Medicaid live in States where abortion is legal but not covered by the program except in Hyde-allowable circumstances.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="id6b7c7d5aa94b49098cc4826cb6643dce"><enum>(12)</enum><text>Moreover, 25 States also prohibit coverage of abortion services in the marketplaces and 10 prohibit coverage in private health insurance plans under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (<external-xref legal-doc="public-law" parsable-cite="pl/111/148">Public Law 111–148</external-xref>). Conversely, 8 States have no coverage limitations, and an additional 12 require coverage in Medicaid, private and marketplace plans.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H00C7A2F50D8446FDA574D231BA9D0AE3"><enum>(13)</enum><text>A recent report details how restrictions on abortion services coverage interfere with a person’s individual decision making, with their health and well-being, with their economic security, with their vulnerability to intimate partner violence, and with their constitutionally protected right to a safe and normal health care service.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H3E103CFE058E485B9CD8836EC346C6CD"><enum>(14)</enum><text>About 25 percent of women covered by Medicaid seeking abortion services must carry their pregnancies to term because they are unable to obtain funds for their care. Government-imposed barriers to abortion services restrict people’s decisions on if, when, and how to parent, and have long-lasting and life-altering harmful effects on the pregnant person, their families and their communities. Those who seek and are denied abortion services are more likely to remain in or fall into poverty than those who access the care they need.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HCFFFB027EFCD45BB8D07EA334CE6D9B8"><enum>(15)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Restrictions on abortion service coverage have a disproportionately harmful impact on women with low incomes, women of color, immigrant women, LGBTQ people, and young women. Additionally, numerous State-imposed barriers make it disparately difficult for low-income people, people of color, immigrants, LGBTQ people, and young people to access the health care and resources necessary to prevent unintended pregnancy or to assure that they are able to carry healthy pregnancies to term. Furthermore, young people of reproductive age (ages 15 to 24) are more likely to have a lower income than those older than that, and this income gap is greater for young BIPOC. Without insurance coverage for abortion services, young people are at greater risk of not having the economic means to afford care outside of insurance. Young people face disproportionate access barriers to abortion, including parental involvement requirement (notification and consent) and cost, in addition to barriers to contraception and inadequate and incomplete sexual and sexuality education. These challenges, which are magnified for BIPOC and queer, trans, and nonbinary youth, can cause significant delays in access to needed care, and could ultimately harm the life of the young person seeking abortion services. These institutionalized barriers deny young people’s right to bodily autonomy and can force young people to encounter an abusive parent or guardian, ignores trusted relationships young people may have with adults other than a parent or legal guardian, and in the case of the judicial bypass process, may force young BIPOC to interact with a legal system that has historically targeted and caused harm to communities of color.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H7A47207F60A24C5B906DA91F7A55B464"><enum>(16)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">These and other government-created and government-institutionalized barriers—including the restriction on funding for abortion services in Federal programs—exacerbate and create poverty and racial inequality in income, wealth-generation, and access to services.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HBC9B497ABFE446EAB9AC862694D20343"><enum>(17)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Access to health care, including abortion services, promotes the general welfare of people living in the United States. Singling out abortion services for funding restrictions in health care programs otherwise designed to promote the health and well-being of people in the United States has cost pregnant people their lives, their livelihoods, their ability to obtain or maintain economic security for themselves and their families, their ability to meet their family’s basic needs, their ability to continue their education without disruption, and their ability to break free of abusive relationships.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H87CD976A049C4DDCA73AEDC94D98B8A0"><enum>(18)</enum><text>Like other health care and health insurance markets in the United States, abortion services and public insurance programs are commercial activities that affect interstate commerce.
