Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Improving Law Enforcement Officer Safety and Wellness Through Data Act of 2025.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following: 
(1)There has been a rise in anti-police rhetoric and a corresponding rise in violence against law enforcement officers. (2)In 2022, a total of 60 police officers were feloniously killed in the line of duty. 
(3)Nearly 30 percent of police officer killings in 2022 were caused by unprovoked attacks or ambushes on officers. (4)Law enforcement officers bravely put themselves at risk for the betterment of society. 
(5)A data collection that represents the full circumstances surrounding violent attacks and ambush attacks on law enforcement officers is vital for the provision of needed Federal resources to Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers. (6)Police suffer assaults and other offenses that do not rise to the level of Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted or National Incident-Based Reporting System reporting due to the frequency of such incidents, lower risk to officers, and minimal administrative resources to report such frequent events. 
(7)The mental health of law enforcement officers has suffered due to overwork, recruitment issues, and the general stress of their work. (8)The people of the United States will always remember the victims of these hateful attacks against law enforcement officers and stand in solidarity with individuals affected by these senseless tragedies and incidents of hate that have affected law enforcement communities and their families. 
(9)The United States must demonstrate to its brave law enforcement officers that they are important, valued, and respected. (10)Congress has made a commitment to helping communities protect the lives of their police officers, as evidenced by the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 (Public Law 114–155; 130 Stat. 389) and other laws. 
(11)Subsection (c) of the Uniform Federal Crime Reporting Act of 1988 (34 U.S.C. 41303(c)) requires the Attorney General to acquire, collect, classify, and preserve national data on Federal criminal offenses as part of the Uniform Crime Reports and requires all Federal departments and agencies that investigate criminal activity to report details about crime within their respective jurisdiction to the Attorney General in a uniform matter and on a form prescribed by the Attorney General.
