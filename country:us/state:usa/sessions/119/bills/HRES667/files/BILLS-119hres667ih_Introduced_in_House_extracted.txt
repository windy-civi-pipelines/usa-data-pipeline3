Whereas the war in Afghanistan, from October 7, 2001, to August 30, 2021, was the longest armed conflict in the history of the United States; Whereas more than 800,000 members of the Armed Forces deployed to Afghanistan over the course of two decades in defense of the Nation and its interests; 
Whereas 2,461 of such members laid down their lives in service, and more than 20,000 others were wounded, with scars both physical and invisible; Whereas thousands of members continue to live with the lasting effects of post-traumatic stress, traumatic brain injuries, and other service-connected conditions; 
Whereas Gold Star families, military spouses, children, and parents bore immeasurable burdens and made enduring sacrifices in support of the Nation; and Whereas the final chapter of the conflict culminated in a terrorist attack at Abbey Gate of Hamid Karzai International Airport on August 26, 2021, in which 13 such members were killed during the evacuation of American citizens and Afghan allies: Now, therefore, be it 
That the House of Representatives— (1)honors the courage, service, and sacrifice of all Americans who served in the war in Afghanistan; 
(2)solemnly remembers the 2,461 members of the Armed Forces who gave their lives in the conflict, including the 13 who were killed on August 26, 2021, during the final days of the withdrawal; (3)expresses profound gratitude to all veterans of the Afghanistan war, to their families, and to the Gold Star families whose loved ones gave everything in defense of the Nation; and
