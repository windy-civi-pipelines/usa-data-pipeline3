            Short title
 This Act may be cited as the Taiwan Energy Security and Anti-Embargo Act of 2025.

Section 2:

            Findings
 Congress makes the following findings:  (1) Taiwan is a vital democratic partner the energy security of which is critical to the strategic interests of the United States in the Indo-Pacific region.
            
            
                (2)
 Enhancing Taiwan’s energy resilience through diversified and reliable sources reduces vulnerability to coercion, disruption, or attack by authoritarian regimes.
            
            
                (3)
 The United States possesses abundant supplies of liquefied natural gas and other energy resources that support economic growth, job creation, and the national security interests of the United States.
            
            
                (4)
 Promoting United States energy exports to and partnerships with Taiwan aligns with United States energy diplomacy objectives, strengthens bilateral economic and security ties, and contributes to regional stability.
            
            
                (5)
 The Alaska Liquefied Natural Gas Project, which has received pledged support from Taiwan’s state energy firm CPC Corp, would enhance the ability of the United States to supply Taiwan and other allies and partners of the United States in the Indo-Pacific with a cost-effective, reliable supply of energy.
            
            
                (6)
 Taiwan’s energy infrastructure, including electric grid systems and liquefied natural gas import facilities, is vulnerable to asymmetric and kinetic threats from the People’s Republic of China.
            
            
                (7)
 Supporting Taiwan’s efforts to improve the resilience and security of its energy infrastructure advances deterrence and promotes continuity of government operations in the event of a crisis.

            Findings and sense of Congress regarding Taiwan’s use of nuclear energy
            
                (a)
                Findings
 Congress makes the following findings:  (1) According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, nuclear energy—
                    
                        (A)
 is the second safest source of energy;   (B) is one of only 2 clean energies that offer non-stop baseload power required for sustainable economic growth and improved human welfare; and
                    
                    
                        (C)
 when compared with other sources of electricity from cradle to grave, has the lowest carbon footprint, uses fewer materials, and takes up less land.
                    
                
                
                    (2)
 A nuclear fuel assembly lasts up to 6 years, making supply more resistant to maritime disruption.
                
                
                    (3)
 Taiwan has built a robust civilian nuclear capability over previous decades that has shown the potential to provide clean, reliable power to Taiwan.
                
                
                    (4)
 On May 17, 2025, the Maanshan-2, Taiwan’s last operating nuclear power plant, was shut down after its 40-year operating license expired.
                
                
                    (5)
 There are compelling economic and security reasons to evaluate placing existing infrastructure back in service to ensure Taiwan has clean, reliable power that is more resilient in a contingency.
                
                
                    (6)
 As a result of Taiwan’s substantial use of energy in industrial manufacturing and production, and emerging energy requirements for electrification, artificial intelligence, and data center support, there is considerable benefit for Taiwan to evaluate new small modular reactors technology to augment its energy capacity and resilience.
                
                
                    (7)
 As Taiwan modernizes its military, the power demand from command-and-control systems, intelligence platforms, drone operations, and joint battlespace integration will continue to increase.
                
            
            
                (b)
                Sense of Congress
 It is the sense of Congress that—  (1) it is in the interests of both the United States and Taiwan for the Government of Taiwan to consider—
                    
                        (A)
 maintaining nuclear power as an energy source; and   (B) utilizing new nuclear technologies, including Gen III+ nuclear reactors and small modular reactor technology; and
                    
                
                
                    (2)
 the United States should prioritize assistance and cooperation with Taiwan on nuclear energy to improve technology exports and job creation in the United States and energy security and resilience in Taiwan.

                        (1)
                        In general
 The Secretary of Transportation may provide insurance and reinsurance under this chapter for any vessel engaged in commerce transporting critical energy, humanitarian, or other goods to Taiwan or another strategic partner of the United States that is facing coercive maritime threats if the Secretary determines, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, and the Director of National Intelligence, that providing such insurance or reinsurance is necessary to support vital strategic commerce or to deter coercive maritime behavior that undermines regional security.
                    
                    
                        (2)
                        Nonapplicability of certain condition
 The condition under section 53902(c) shall not apply with respect to a vessel described in paragraph (1).

        119th CONGRESS
        1st Session
        S. 2722
        IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
        
            September 4, 2025
            Mr. Ricketts (for himself and Mr. Coons) introduced the following bill; which was
                read twice and referred to the Committee on
                    Foreign Relations
        
        A BILL
        To promote the energy security of Taiwan, and for other
            purposes.
    
    
        
            1.
            Short title
 This Act may be cited as the Taiwan Energy Security and Anti-Embargo Act of 2025.
        
        
            2.
            Findings
 Congress makes the following findings:  (1) Taiwan is a vital democratic partner the energy security of which is critical to the strategic interests of the United States in the Indo-Pacific region.
            
            
                (2)
 Enhancing Taiwan’s energy resilience through diversified and reliable sources reduces vulnerability to coercion, disruption, or attack by authoritarian regimes.
            
            
                (3)
 The United States possesses abundant supplies of liquefied natural gas and other energy resources that support economic growth, job creation, and the national security interests of the United States.
            
            
                (4)
 Promoting United States energy exports to and partnerships with Taiwan aligns with United States energy diplomacy objectives, strengthens bilateral economic and security ties, and contributes to regional stability.
            
            
                (5)
 The Alaska Liquefied Natural Gas Project, which has received pledged support from Taiwan’s state energy firm CPC Corp, would enhance the ability of the United States to supply Taiwan and other allies and partners of the United States in the Indo-Pacific with a cost-effective, reliable supply of energy.
            
            
                (6)
 Taiwan’s energy infrastructure, including electric grid systems and liquefied natural gas import facilities, is vulnerable to asymmetric and kinetic threats from the People’s Republic of China.
            
            
                (7)
 Supporting Taiwan’s efforts to improve the resilience and security of its energy infrastructure advances deterrence and promotes continuity of government operations in the event of a crisis.

            Findings and sense of Congress regarding Taiwan’s use of nuclear energy
            
                (a)
                Findings
 Congress makes the following findings:  (1) According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, nuclear energy—
                    
                        (A)
 is the second safest source of energy;   (B) is one of only 2 clean energies that offer non-stop baseload power required for sustainable economic growth and improved human welfare; and
                    
                    
                        (C)
 when compared with other sources of electricity from cradle to grave, has the lowest carbon footprint, uses fewer materials, and takes up less land.
                    
                
                
                    (2)
 A nuclear fuel assembly lasts up to 6 years, making supply more resistant to maritime disruption.
                
                
                    (3)
 Taiwan has built a robust civilian nuclear capability over previous decades that has shown the potential to provide clean, reliable power to Taiwan.
                
                
                    (4)
 On May 17, 2025, the Maanshan-2, Taiwan’s last operating nuclear power plant, was shut down after its 40-year operating license expired.
                
                
                    (5)
 There are compelling economic and security reasons to evaluate placing existing infrastructure back in service to ensure Taiwan has clean, reliable power that is more resilient in a contingency.
                
                
                    (6)
 As a result of Taiwan’s substantial use of energy in industrial manufacturing and production, and emerging energy requirements for electrification, artificial intelligence, and data center support, there is considerable benefit for Taiwan to evaluate new small modular reactors technology to augment its energy capacity and resilience.
                
                
                    (7)
 As Taiwan modernizes its military, the power demand from command-and-control systems, intelligence platforms, drone operations, and joint battlespace integration will continue to increase.
                
            
            
                (b)
                Sense of Congress
 It is the sense of Congress that—  (1) it is in the interests of both the United States and Taiwan for the Government of Taiwan to consider—
                    
                        (A)
 maintaining nuclear power as an energy source; and   (B) utilizing new nuclear technologies, including Gen III+ nuclear reactors and small modular reactor technology; and
                    
                
                
                    (2)
 the United States should prioritize assistance and cooperation with Taiwan on nuclear energy to improve technology exports and job creation in the United States and energy security and resilience in Taiwan.

                    (d)
                    Vessels transporting vital goods to strategic partners
                    
                        (1)
                        In general
 The Secretary of Transportation may provide insurance and reinsurance under this chapter for any vessel engaged in commerce transporting critical energy, humanitarian, or other goods to Taiwan or another strategic partner of the United States that is facing coercive maritime threats if the Secretary determines, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, and the Director of National Intelligence, that providing such insurance or reinsurance is necessary to support vital strategic commerce or to deter coercive maritime behavior that undermines regional security.
                    
                    
                        (2)
                        Nonapplicability of certain condition
 The condition under section 53902(c) shall not apply with respect to a vessel described in paragraph (1).
