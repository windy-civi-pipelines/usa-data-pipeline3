                (a)
                Findings
 Congress finds that—  (1) agriculture and related industries—
                    
                        (A)
 contributed $1,530,000,000,000 to the gross domestic product of the United States (5.6 percent of the total gross domestic product of the United States) in 2023; and
                    
                    
                        (B)
 provided 22,000,000 jobs domestically (10.4 percent of total employment in the United States) in 2022;
                    
                
                
                    (2)
 the National Institute of Food and Agriculture provides more than $1,700,000,000 in research funding each year to schools of agriculture;
                
                
                    (3)
 a study published in 2015 found that deferred maintenance needs at 91 schools of agriculture across the United States totaled $8,400,000,000, with a total replacement cost of $29,000,000,000;
                
                
                    (4)
 a study published in 2021 found that deferred maintenance needs at schools of agriculture across the United States had increased to $11,500,000,000, with a total replacement cost of $38,100,000,000; and
                
                
                    (5)
 infrastructure investments must be made at schools of agriculture to ensure that United States agricultural research remains globally competitive.

                Findings
 Congress finds that—  (1) agriculture and related industries—
                    
                        (A)
 contributed $1,530,000,000,000 to the gross domestic product of the United States (5.6 percent of the total gross domestic product of the United States) in 2023; and
                    
                    
                        (B)
 provided 22,000,000 jobs domestically (10.4 percent of total employment in the United States) in 2022;
                    
                
                
                    (2)
 the National Institute of Food and Agriculture provides more than $1,700,000,000 in research funding each year to schools of agriculture;
                
                
                    (3)
 a study published in 2015 found that deferred maintenance needs at 91 schools of agriculture across the United States totaled $8,400,000,000, with a total replacement cost of $29,000,000,000;
                
                
                    (4)
 a study published in 2021 found that deferred maintenance needs at schools of agriculture across the United States had increased to $11,500,000,000, with a total replacement cost of $38,100,000,000; and
                
                
                    (5)
 infrastructure investments must be made at schools of agriculture to ensure that United States agricultural research remains globally competitive.
