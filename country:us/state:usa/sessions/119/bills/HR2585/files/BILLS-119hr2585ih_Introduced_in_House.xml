This denial and distortion dishonors those who were persecuted, murdered, dispossessed, and exiled, making it even more of a national imperative to educate students in the United States so that they may explore the lessons that these crimes provide for all people, sensitize communities to the circumstances that gave rise to these crimes, and help youth be less susceptible to the falsehood of genocide denial and distortion and to the destructive messages of hate that arise from denial and distortion.</text></paragraph></section> <section id="H9244E468A9A245B19C6287A42C933F28"><enum>3.</enum><header>Definitions</header><text display-inline="no-display-inline">In this Act:</text>
