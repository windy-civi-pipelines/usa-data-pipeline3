Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Armenian Genocide Education Act.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following: 
(1)The United States has demonstrated a commitment to remembrance and education about the Armenian Genocide of 1915–1923 through the United States Government’s May 28, 1951, written statement to the International Court of Justice regarding the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide; through President Ronald Reagan’s Proclamation No. 4838 on April 22, 1981; by H.J. Res 148, adopted on April 8, 1975; H.J. Res 247, adopted on September 10, 1984; H. Res. 296, adopted on October 29, 2019; S. Res. 150, adopted on December 12, 2019; and President Joe Biden’s April 24, 2021, statement recognizing the Armenian Genocide. (2)H. Res. 296 and S. Res. 150 cite the Ottoman Empire’s campaign of genocide against Armenian, Greek, Assyrian, Chaldean, Syriac, Aramean, Maronite and other Christians, and call on the United States to— 
(A)reject efforts to enlist, engage, or otherwise associate the United States Government with denial of the Armenian Genocide or any other genocide; and (B)encourage education and public understanding of the facts of the Armenian Genocide, including the United States role in the humanitarian relief effort, and the relevance of the Armenian Genocide to modern-day crimes against humanity. 
(3)Today, those who deny that the Ottoman Empire systematically planned, organized, and implemented a campaign of genocide against Armenian, Greek, Assyrian, Chaldean, Syriac, Aramean, Maronite, and other Christians or who seek to distort the true nature of these crimes continue to find forums, especially online. This denial and distortion dishonors those who were persecuted, murdered, dispossessed, and exiled, making it even more of a national imperative to educate students in the United States so that they may explore the lessons that these crimes provide for all people, sensitize communities to the circumstances that gave rise to these crimes, and help youth be less susceptible to the falsehood of genocide denial and distortion and to the destructive messages of hate that arise from denial and distortion.

(2)Armenian Genocide education programThe term Armenian Genocide education program means a program that has as its specific and primary purpose the improvement of awareness and understanding of the history, lessons, consequences, and ongoing costs of the Armenian Genocide, and which will serve as a means of promoting justice and preventing genocide, hate, and bigotry against any group of people.
