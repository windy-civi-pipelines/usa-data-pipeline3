Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Career and Technical Education Access Act.

Section 2:
2.Findings and purposes (a)FindingsCongress finds the following: 
(1)The demand for skilled workers in industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, construction, and information technology is increasing. (2)Connecticut’s Technical Education and Career System has demonstrated that a statewide career and technical education (in this Act referred to as CTE) model can successfully prepare students for both postsecondary education and high-demand careers. 
(3)Expanding CTE high schools nationwide will create greater economic opportunities for students, particularly those in under-resourced communities. (4)Students in States without dedicated CTE high schools often lack access to hands-on, work-based learning opportunities. 
(5)Students in rural or underserved areas may lack access to in-person CTE programs, necessitating the development of online and hybrid learning options to expand educational opportunities.  (b)PurposesThe purposes of this Act are to— 
(1)create a voluntary Federal grant program to allow States to establish, expand, or improve CTE programs tailored to their local workforce needs; (2)provide flexibility for States to implement CTE programs through standalone CTE high schools, regional career centers, or hybrid models; 
(3)ensure strong industry partnerships and work-based learning opportunities in all CTE programs established or supported by a grant under this Act; (4)mandate States that receive a grant under this Act to conduct a workforce alignment assessment every 3 years to assess labor market needs and ensure alignment of CTE programs with in-demand jobs; 
(5)incentivize employer participation by encouraging funding contributions, equipment donations, paid internships or apprenticeships, and hiring preferences for CTE graduates; (6)integrate dual-enrollment programs with junior or community colleges to ensure students can earn college credit while completing high school CTE programs; 
(7)require that students completing CTE programs receive automatic credit transfer options for institutions of higher education, ensuring their coursework is recognized at participating institutions; (8)permit States to use grant funds to develop and implement online and hybrid CTE programs, expanding access to students in remote or underserved areas; and  
(9)establish a CTE Pell Grant for public secondary school students, expanding access to financial aid for industry-recognized certifications and training.
