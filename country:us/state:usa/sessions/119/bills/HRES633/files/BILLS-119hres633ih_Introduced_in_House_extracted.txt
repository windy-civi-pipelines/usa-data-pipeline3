Whereas the Prince Hall Freemasons employed advocacy and community work to assist Blacks seeking citizenship, education, and economic advancement; Whereas, in 1777, Prince Hall petitioned the Massachusetts government to abolish slavery and is considered by some to be the first to publicly proclaim that Black people should be granted the rights laid out in the Declaration of Independence;

Whereas the resettlement plan requested the Massachusetts General Court to provide passage for families with the necessary provisions, utensils, and articles, as well as money to procure lands to settle upon; Whereas, in 1788, Prince Hall petitioned the Massachusetts Legislature to protect Black sailors from being kidnapped and sold into slavery;
Whereas Prince Hallâ€™s influence remains within the 5,000 lodges and 47 grand lodges who trace their lineage to the original lodge he founded; and  Whereas this resolution may be cited as the Original Resolution Honoring Prince Hall: Now, therefore, be it
