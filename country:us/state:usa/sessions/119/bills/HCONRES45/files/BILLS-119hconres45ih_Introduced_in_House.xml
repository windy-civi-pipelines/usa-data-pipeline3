law respecting an establishment of religion, prohibiting the free exercise of religion, or abridging the freedom of speech, the freedom of the press, the right to peaceably assemble, or to petition for a governmental redress of grievances, and was adopted on December 15, 1791, as 1 of the 10 amendments that constitute the Bill of Rights;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Bill of Rights, specifically the First Amendment to the Constitution, calls for the right of all persons to peaceably assemble, and to this end, all persons, regardless of their physical ability, shall be offered

1990 (<external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/42/12101">42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.</external-xref>), there have been unprecedented advances in all forms of technology, typified by automatic doors;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, in 2024, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 1 in 4 adults, or more than 70,000,000 people, have a disability in the United States;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas disability is a universal concern, as an aging population increases the incidence of frailty and disability;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, as significant advances in medical treatment result in increased survival rates, the incidence of disability increases;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, in 2024, the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that 31 percent of all veterans, or 5,500,000 veterans, had a service-connected disability;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, in 2024, the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that the unemployment rate of persons with a disability was nearly twice that of nondisabled adults;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, in 2024, the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that people of color

certain federally funded facilities are designed and constructed to be accessible to people with disabilities;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States Access Board (referred to in this preamble as the <quote>Board</quote>) issued a final rule in August 2023 addressing accessibility guidelines for pedestrian facilities in the public right-of-way that addresses various issues, including access for blind pedestrians at street crossings, wheelchair access to on-street parking, and various constraints posed by space limitations, roadway design practices, slope, and terrain;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the August 2023 guidelines of the Board (referred to in this preamble as the <quote>guidelines</quote>) cover pedestrian access to sidewalks and streets, including crosswalks, curb ramps, street furnishings, pedestrian signals, parking, and other components of public rights-of-way;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the aim of the Board in developing the guidelines was to ensure that access for persons with disabilities is provided wherever a pedestrian way is newly built or altered, and that the same degree of convenience, connection, and safety afforded the public generally is available to pedestrians with disabilities;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Department of Transportation adopted the guidelines in December 2024,
