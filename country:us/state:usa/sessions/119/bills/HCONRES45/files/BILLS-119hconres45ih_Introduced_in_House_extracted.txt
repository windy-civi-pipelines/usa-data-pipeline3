andWhereas the United States was founded on principles of equality and freedom, and those principles require that all people, including people with disabilities, are able to engage as equal members of society: Now, therefore, be itThat Congress—(1)recognizes that people with disabilities in the United States experience barriers to access on a daily basis;(2)reaffirms its support of Public Law 90–480 (commonly known as the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968) (42 U.S.C. 4151 et seq.) and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.), and encourages full compliance with those Acts;
