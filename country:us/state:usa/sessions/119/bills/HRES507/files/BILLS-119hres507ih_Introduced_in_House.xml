</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas there is new hope for patients with FSGS, with clinical trials underway for products that may delay progression of FSGS and the onset of kidney disease, including the potential for FDA approved therapies in the near future, and significant progress being made by scientists, regulators, patient groups, and industry to validate proteinuria as an indicator of improvement in patients;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas patients, families, advocacy organizations like NephCure, health care providers, industry, and researchers are working tirelessly to raise awareness, promote early detection, and develop new innovative therapies for FSGS;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas millions of dollars have been raised for research on the severe rare kidney disease FSGS at the Tampa Pig Jig, an event started in 2011 when 3 friends wanted to raise money for a friend diagnosed with the rare kidney disease FSGS and is now attended by about 10,000 people annually in pursuit of a cure for this devastating disease;
