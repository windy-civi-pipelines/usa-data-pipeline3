Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Polisario Front Terrorist Designation Act.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following: 
(1)The Polisario Front, founded in 1973, is a separatist group operating primarily in Western Sahara and the Tindouf region of Algeria, seeking independence for Western Sahara from Moroccan sovereignty. (2)The Polisario Front has a documented history of ideological and operational ties with Iran, a state sponsor of terrorism, dating back at least to 1980, when Polisario fighters publicly posed with portraits of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in a bid to attract revolutionary credibility and Iranian patronage. 
(3)According to reporting by Jeune Afrique, 3 Hezbollah officers served as trainers in the Tindouf camps in 2018. One of the named trainers, since killed in a November 2023 Israeli airstrike in Syria, had previously been sanctioned by the United States for orchestrating the 2007 Karbala raid in Iraq that killed 5 American soldiers. (4)Iran’s support has reportedly advanced from training to the provision of lethal hardware. In a 2022 livestream, Polisario Interior Minister Omar Mansour stated that his fighters were training on assembling and operating armed drones. A year later, images disseminated via Polisario-controlled social media channels showed Iranian-type munitions, as confirmed by open-source weapons researchers. 
(5)The Washington Post reported in April 2025 that Iran has trained Polisario Front fighters and provided them with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), deepening concerns about the group's growing capabilities and external sponsorship.  (6) The Syrian wing of the PKK, a designated terrorist organization, took part in the front's meeting called Sahrawi Solidarity Summit in the Sahrawi camps on January 4–7 2025.

Section 3:

(2)A description of the Polisario Front’s relationships, support, funding, and associations with Iran and Russia. (3)A description of the Polisario Front’s relationships, support, funding and associations with Foreign Terrorist Organizations Hezbollah, the IRGC, and the PKK. 
(4)A description and analysis of whether the Polisario Front has ever intentionally attacked civilian targets.
