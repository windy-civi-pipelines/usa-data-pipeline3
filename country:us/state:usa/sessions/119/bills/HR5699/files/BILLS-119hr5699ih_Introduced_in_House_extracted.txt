Section 3:
3.Recreational fishing data collection reform (a)In generalThe Administrator shall reform the MRIP in effect as of the date of the enactment of this section to meet the unique needs of individual regions and States, taking into consideration the needs of State-level programs related to recreational fishing catch and effort surveys in effect as of the date of the enactment of this section to ensure that such reform does not unnecessarily dilute the effectiveness of such programs. 
(b)National Academies 
(1)Standing committee 
(A)In generalThe Administrator shall enter into an agreement with the National Academies to establish a standing committee within the National Academies that shall meet regularly to discuss issues related to recreational fisheries data collection and management. (B)IndependenceIn carrying out this subsection, the standing committee shall operate independently and without the influence of the Administrator. 
(C)CompositionThe standing committee shall include individuals who are experts in recreational fisheries data collection and management, including representatives from State fish and wildlife agencies. (2)Consultation regarding PSE (A)In generalIf the PSE for data collected through the MRIP for a given seasonal fishery reaches or exceeds 30 percent in a given wave, or if a State submits a petition with respect to a given seasonal fishery under paragraph (4), the Administrator shall consult with the standing committee regarding options— 
(i)to reduce the PSE of such seasonal fishery; or (ii)if reducing the PSE of such seasonal fishery is not practicable, to adjust the management of such seasonal fishery, including by using—

(B)ReportAfter the Administrator consults with the standing committee under subparagraph (A) with respect to a seasonal fishery described in that subparagraph, the Administrator shall, not later than 6 months after the date on which either the PSE for data collected through the MRIP for such seasonal fishery exceeds 30 percent in a given wave or the Administrator receives a petition submitted by a State under paragraph (4), publish a report specifying— (i)the options considered under that subparagraph (A); 
(ii)the recommendation of the Administrator regarding how— (I)to reduce the PSE for data collected through the MRIP for such seasonal fishery; or 
(II)to adjust the management of such seasonal fishery in a manner that allows continued access and considers recommendations contained in the report submitted to Congress under section 102 of the Modernizing Recreational Fisheries Management Act of 2018 (Public Law 115–405); and (iii)the reasoning, written in a manner easily understood by the public, for giving such recommendation. 
(C)Regional Fishery Management CouncilIf the Administrator publishes a report under subparagraph (B) with respect to a seasonal fishery described in subparagraph (A), the Administrator shall send such report to the relevant Regional Fishery Management Council for consideration. (3)ConsiderationIn carrying out paragraphs (1) and (2), the Administrator and the standing committee shall consider issues including the following: 
(A)Whether the data collected through the MRIP is appropriate and useful for management decisions, including options to improve data collection methods. (B)The extent to which existing and potential data collection options are— 
(i)burdensome to anglers; and (ii)an efficient or appropriate use of resources. 
(C)Whether and to what extent specific recommendations from the report published by the National Academies titled Data and Management Strategies for Recreational Fisheries with Annual Catch Limits (2021) and other relevant National Academies activities can and should be applied in light of the particular context of the fishery being considered. (4)Petition to initiate consultationA State may submit to the Administrator a petition for the Administrator to initiate the consultation process under paragraph (2) with respect to a given seasonal fishery if— 
(A)the PSE for data collected through the MRIP for such seasonal fishery is— (i)significantly greater or less than the preceding 3-year average PSE for such seasonal fishery; or 
(ii)substantially greater than the PSE for data collected through State surveys for such seasonal fishery; or (B)data collected through the MRIP for such seasonal fishery is unreliable because the stock of fish of such seasonal fishery is a pulse species. 
(5)Combined reportsIn carrying out this subsection, the Administrator may carry out a single consultation with the standing committee under paragraph (2) with respect to 2 or more species if the Administrator and the standing committee jointly determine the underlying issues that triggered the consultation are highly similar. (c)Alternative to MRIPIf, after consultation with the standing committee and relevant States, the Administrator determines that it is not practicable to reduce the PSE for data collected through the MRIP for a given seasonal fishery to 30 percent or less, the Administrator, in collaboration with the standing committee and relevant States and stakeholders, may develop alternative data collection and monitoring methodologies and, subject to peer review and validation, use such alternative data collection and monitoring methodologies in place of the MRIP for such seasonal fishery. 
(d)Rule of constructionNothing in this section may be construed to override the role of the scientific and statistical committees in advising the Regional Fishery Management Councils regarding recommendations developed pursuant to this section.

Section 4:
4.State recreational fishery catch and effort data collection (a)State recreational fishery catch and effort data collection program (1)In generalA State may, subject to the approval of the Administrator, carry out a program within the waters of such State and Federal waters to collect recreational fishing catch and effort data for individual, or sets of, species that are federally managed.

(f)Stock assessment plan 
(1)In generalThe Secretary shall develop and publish in the Federal Register, on the same schedule as required for each strategic plan required under subsection (b), a plan to conduct stock assessments for priority stocks of fish for which a fishery management plan is in effect under this Act. (2)ContentsEach plan described in paragraph (1) shall— 
(A)for each priority stock of fish for which a stock assessment has previously been conducted— (i)establish a schedule for updating the stock assessment that is reasonable given the biology and characteristics of the stock of fish; and 
(ii)subject to the availability of appropriations, require completion of a new stock assessment, or an update of the most recent stock assessment— (I)every 5 years; or 
(II)within such other time period specified and justified by the Secretary in the plan; (B)for each priority stock of fish for which a stock assessment has not previously been conducted—

(3)Waiver of stock assessment requirementNotwithstanding subparagraphs (A)(ii) and (B)(ii) of paragraph (2), a stock assessment is not required for a stock of fish in the plan described in paragraph (1) if the Secretary determines that such stock assessment is not necessary and justifies such determination in the Federal Register notice required by this subsection..
