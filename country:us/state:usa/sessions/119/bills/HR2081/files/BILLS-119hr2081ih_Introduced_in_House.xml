<paragraph id="H67221D6B3E754221B3F8100604491782"><enum>(1)</enum><text>The Vietnam War, (1954–1975), a conflict that pitted the communist Government of North Vietnam and its allies in South Vietnam, known as the Viet Cong, against the Government of South Vietnam, involved thousands of U.S. servicemembers and volunteers over its course. U.S. military advisers, present in small numbers throughout the 1950s, were introduced on a large scale beginning in 1961, and active combat units were introduced in 1965. As early as February 1962, the number of American military forces in Vietnam warranted the assignment of American Red Cross field directors.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H145F9D055F2241569BC0B723654377C8"><enum>(2)</enum><text>Women were not subject to the Vietnam-era draft, but thousands volunteered. The first American Red Cross Field Directors were sent to South Vietnam in February 1962. The last Red Cross staff members to serve in-country departed in March 1973. Official records indicate that a total of 1,120 women served with the Red Cross in Vietnam during that 11-year period. Of that number, 627 were young women who were part of the organization’s Supplemental Recreation Activities Overseas (SRAO) program.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H9354473894484CBBB9358D1CF2044FA3"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Based on Red Cross estimates, around 280,500 servicemen took part in these recreation programs and the women, affectionately known as <quote>Donut Dollies</quote>, traveled 27,000 miles by jeep, truck, airplane, and helicopter every month. Red Cross officials estimate that, during the seven years the program was in operation, the women logged over 2,125,000 miles. The first SRAO unit opened at Danang in September 1965. Others quickly followed at Bien Hoa, Nha Trang, Cam Ranh Air Force and Army bases, Dian, Quang Tri, Phu Bai, Lai Khe, Dong Tam, Qui Nhon, Xuan Loc, and more. In all, there were 28 SRAO unit locations throughout the country.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H03B585A460314B6BAE438F38AB14FC26"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Military commanders expressed high praise for the Red Cross volunteers, calling the services of the organization <quote>indispensable</quote> and <quote>prime factors</quote> in their efforts to maintain the high morale of their men and to look after their welfare. Writing to Red Cross national headquarters in 1968, General William Westmoreland, then commander of the U.S. forces in Southeast Asia, stated, <quote>Serving our men on the battlefields here in Vietnam, the American Red Cross is a hotline to the folks back home, an oasis in the heat of battle, and a comfort during hospitalization.</quote>.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H4E6710764C4C4BAD934885144B46CE94"><enum>(5)</enum><text>These Red Cross volunteers shared with military personnel the hardship and privation of life in a war zone and were subject to the dangers of war. Many staff were injured. Five American Red Cross workers died in-country. Three of those were women, Hanna E. Crews, Virginia E. Kirsch, and Lucinda J. Richter, all of whom were members of the SRAO program.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HAD1ED0B86D244D718405B5CE55F45D4D"><enum>(6)</enum><text>The Donut Dollies volunteered to be sent to the frontlines to support servicemembers directly engaged with the enemy during the Vietnam conflict. The extraordinary efforts of these volunteers throughout the extent of America’s involvement in the Vietnam conflict is deserving of official recognition.</text></paragraph></section>
