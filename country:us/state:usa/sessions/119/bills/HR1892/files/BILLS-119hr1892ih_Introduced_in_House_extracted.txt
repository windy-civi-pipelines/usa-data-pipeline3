Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Wireless Electric Vehicle Charging Grant Program Act of 2025.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following:(1)Electric vehicles are crucial to cutting greenhouse gas emissions, reducing reliance on fossil fuels, strengthening United States economic and national security, and combating the climate crisis. As of 2019, the transportation sector accounts for 29 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions, which is the most of any sector.(2)Increasing the adoption of electric vehicles will reduce pollution and increase air quality for communities located near roads with high traffic density or high-volume routes.(3)As the automotive industry shifts towards electric vehicles, investing in new electric vehicle technologies will be crucial to enhancing America’s competitiveness, creating jobs, and ensuring continued economic growth.(4)Range anxiety is one of the chief barriers to electric vehicle adoption. If deployed strategically, wireless electric vehicle charging could help by providing drivers convenient opportunities to charge and extend the range of electric vehicles.(5)Wireless charging technologies could be invaluable for electric transit buses, trucking, fleet vehicles, and autonomous electric vehicles, allowing for convenient and hands-free charging, while also lowering costs, as effective wireless charging would reduce the need for larger and heavier batteries.(6)Wireless and dynamic charging can also reduce pressure on the grid, allowing vehicles to charge through space and time, shaving peak demand and reducing the need to build massive charging capacity at any given location to meet growing electric vehicle charging demand.(7)Wireless can enhance electrification of fleets, including medium and heavy-duty vehicles, helping them meet operational needs that cannot be met solely by traditional charging systems.(8)Wireless electric vehicle charging has the potential to make electric vehicles more accessible and allow all people of the United States, regardless of physical ability, to enjoy the benefits of electric vehicles.(9)It is critical to establish a resilient and robust domestic supply chain for all electric vehicle charging infrastructure. With strong Buy America requirements, federally funded programs can incentivize companies to build facilities in the United States, creating good paying jobs and economic growth for communities.

Section 3:
3.Establishment of Wireless Electric Vehicle Charging Grant ProgramThe Secretary of Transportation shall establish a program, in coordination with the Department of Energy, to award grants on a competitive basis to eligible entities for projects to construct, install, or improve existing wireless charging infrastructure and technology for electric vehicles, including performance, safety, electromagnetic compatibility, interoperability, development, and testing of wireless charging.
