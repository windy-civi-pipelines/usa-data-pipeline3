<preamble>
<whereas><text>Whereas, on February 27, 2023, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported that the Islamic Republic of Iran had enriched uranium to 83.7 percent, which is sufficient for a crude nuclear device and just short of the standard 90 percent threshold typically needed for weapons-grade fissile material;</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas, on September 16, 2023, the IAEA reported that the Islamic Republic of Iran banned the activities of nearly one-third of the IAEA’s most experienced nuclear inspectors in Iran, a decision that, according to IAEA Director-General Rafael Grossi, harmed the IAEA’s ability to monitor Iran’s nuclear program;</text></whereas>
<whereas><text>Whereas, on November 15, 2024, the IAEA reported that the Islamic Republic of Iran has continued to expand its enrichment facilities and install additional advanced centrifuges, including at the Natanz Nuclear Facility, where there are 15 cascades of advanced centrifuges, and the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant, where there are advanced preparations for the expansion of the facility;</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas, on February 26, 2025, the IAEA reported that the Islamic Republic of Iran has between 5 and 7 metric tons of enriched uranium, and had increased its total stockpile of 60 percent highly enriched uranium to 274.8 kilograms (605.83 pounds), which, if further enriched, could be sufficient to produce six nuclear weapons;</text></whereas>
<whereas><text>Whereas, on May 31, 2025, the IAEA reported that the stock of 60 percent-enriched uranium of the Islamic Republic of Iran had increased to an estimated 408.6 kg, equivalent to 900.8 pounds, which is an amount that if enriched further could be sufficient enough to produce at least nine nuclear bombs; </text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas, on June 12, 2025, the IAEA Board of Governors, for the first time since 2005, adopted a resolution finding the Islamic Republic of Iran to be in breach of its non-proliferation obligations under the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Safeguards Agreement, which Iran signed in 1974;</text></whereas>
<whereas><text>Whereas the IAEA’s resolution was supported by 19 countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany; </text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas the Islamic Republic of Iran responded to the IAEA action by announcing it would further expand its nuclear program, including by opening an additional enrichment facility and taking other measures; </text></whereas>
<whereas><text>Whereas, President of the United States Donald Trump has been clear that Iran should not be allowed to have a nuclear weapon, including on April 7, 2025, when he stated, “it’s not a complicated formula. Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. That’s all there is.”;</text></whereas> <whereas> <text>Whereas, the Islamic Republic of Iran has repeatedly rejected good-faith diplomatic efforts by the United States and others to address its nuclear program, including on April 8, 2025, when it rejected the dismantlement of its nuclear program, stating, “Our nuclear program cannot be dismantled.”;</text>
        </whereas>
<whereas><text>Whereas, on April 12, 2025, President Trump gave the Islamic Republic of Iran 60 days to negotiate a new agreement in good faith; </text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas the Islamic Republic of Iran failed to negotiate in good faith with the United States and continued to enrich weapons-grade uranium;</text></whereas>
<whereas><text>Whereas, on June 13, 2025, in the face of an existential nuclear threat from the Islamic Republic of Iran and after exhausting all diplomatic avenues, Israel conducted intelligence-driven preemptive strikes to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons and such capability explicitly designed to achieve the destruction of Israel and the United States;</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas these strikes were proportional and targeted against Iran’s nuclear sites, Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) facilities and leaders, nuclear scientists, and related military targets and included the elimination of many senior Islamic Republic military leaders sanctioned by the United States for terrorist activities, including Hossein Salami, and Mohammad Khatami;</text></whereas>
<whereas><text>Whereas Iran’s nuclear sites at the Natanz Nuclear Facility and nuclear sites in Khondab, Khorramabad, Isfahan and Shiraz were targeted and either destroyed or severely degraded;</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas in retaliation, the Islamic Republic of Iran has indiscriminately targeted Israeli civilian centers in cities like Tel Aviv, Ramat Gan, Bat Yam, Rehovot, Haifa, Petah Tikvah, and Jerusalem;</text></whereas>
<whereas><text>Whereas 24 Israelis have already been killed by these attacks and over 590 Israelis have been wounded, with the threat of additional attacks by the regime likely in the future;</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas a nuclear Iran poses a grave threat to the United States, Israel, and the broader Middle East;</text></whereas>
<whereas><text>Whereas Israel’s preemptive strikes achieved national security objectives without risking American lives; and</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas the United States supports Israel in its continuing efforts against Iran’s nuclear aspirations; Now, therefore, be it</text></whereas></preamble>
