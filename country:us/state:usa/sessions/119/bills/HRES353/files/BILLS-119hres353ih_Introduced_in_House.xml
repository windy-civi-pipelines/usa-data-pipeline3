Donald John Trump’s tariffs contradicted trade agreements established by his Administration and other administrations, including the duly ratified and binding treaty obligations of the United States, thereby breaking international laws and norms, leading to countries around the world to enact damaging tariffs on goods and services originating from the United States. His <quote>Liberation Day</quote> scheme, which imposed 10 percent tariffs on all countries, as well as additional tariffs based on a formula for <quote>reciprocity</quote> widely mocked as nonsensical, led to the most significant drop in the financial markets since the 2020 crash triggered by the COVID–19 pandemic.</text></subsection><subsection id="H05113668BEBC48038DF675D670B54901"><enum/><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Additionally, Donald John Trump has threatened foreign nations with invasion, the annexation of territory, and the occupation of sovereign territory through the use of military action.

He has pursued meritless litigation, leveraged his public office for private gain, and perverted the course of justice and the integrity of the judicial system to extract tens of millions of dollars in putative settlements, effectively acting as a conduit for flagrant bribery and extortion. He has restricted the access of the Associated Press after they refused to use the name <quote>Gulf of America</quote> in their reporting and has defied court orders to cease this unconstitutional action.
