 <text>In September 2020, the Air Force awarded a sole-source contract to Northrop Grumman for the ground-based strategic deterrent program (now called Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile program), raising concerns that the absence of competition for the award would result in higher than projected costs to United States taxpayers. The program is intended to replace 400 deployed Minuteman III missiles with more than 600 new missiles, to allow for test flights and spares.</text>

 <text>In January 2024, increases in the total costs of the Sentinel program triggered a review under <external-xref legal-doc="usc-chapter" parsable-cite="usc-chapter/10/325">chapter 325</external-xref> of title 10, United States Code (commonly known as the <quote>Nunn-McCurdy Act</quote>), which is intended to determine whether a program that has experienced large cost overruns should continue, and what, if any, changes should be made to control costs.</text>

 <text>In July 2024, the Department of Defense completed that review and released a new estimate of total costs for the program of $141,000,000,000 in constant 2020 dollars, which is 81 percent (or $63,000,000,000) larger than the program’s baseline 2020 estimate of $78,000,000,000. The total estimated life cycle cost of the Sentinel program (not including warheads) was estimated by the Department of Defense to be $260,000,000,000 in 2020 and is undoubtedly higher today.</text>

 <text>According to public reports, officials of the Department of Defense expect the restructuring effort to delay the Sentinel program by several years. The Department of Defense’s 2025 budget plans called for initial operating capability to be achieved in May 2029, a date that, as of the date of the enactment of this Act, looks unachievable. The Air Force is considering contingency plans that would extend the life of Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles by 11 more years to 2050 if delays continue to plague the Sentinel missiles intended to replace them.</text>

 <text>The National Nuclear Security Administration is developing a replacement intercontinental ballistic missile warhead, the W87–1, for the Sentinel and expanding plutonium pit production to build new warhead cores, costing at least $14,000,000,000 and $18,000,000,000, respectively.</text>

 <text>Even in the absence of an intercontinental ballistic missile leg of the triad, the United States would have an assured retaliatory capability in the form of multiple ballistic missile submarines, which are virtually undetectable, and there are no known, near-term credible threats to the survivability of the ballistic missile submarine force. The survivability of the submarine force will be enhanced as the Department of Defense moves to replace the Ohio class ballistic submarine fleet with the new Columbia class ballistic missile fleet.</text>

 <text>False alarms have happened multiple times and can happen again. For example, in 1980, a false alarm was reported to the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs and was almost reported up to President Jimmy Carter as a real attack but was luckily identified in time. Recent Pentagon reports have found that, as a result of cyberattacks, the President could be faced with false warnings of attack or lose the ability to control nuclear weapons.</text>

 <text>In 1983, Stanislav Petrov, a former lieutenant colonel of the Soviet Air Defense Forces correctly identified a false warning in an early warning system that showed several United States incoming nuclear missiles, preventing Soviet leaders from launching a retaliatory response, earning Colonel Petrov the nickname <quote>the man who saved the world</quote>.</text>

 <text>General James Cartwright, former vice chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and former Commander of the United States Strategic Command, wrote, with Secretary Perry, <quote>[T]he greatest danger is not a Russian bolt but a US blunder—that we might accidentally stumble into nuclear war. As we make decisions about which weapons to buy, we should use this simple rule: If a nuclear weapon increases the risk of accidental war and is not needed to deter an intentional attack, we should not build it. … Certain nuclear weapons, such as … the [intercontinental ballistic missile], carry higher risks of accidental war that, fortunately, we no longer need to bear. We are safer without these expensive weapons, and it would be foolish to replace them.</quote>.</text>
