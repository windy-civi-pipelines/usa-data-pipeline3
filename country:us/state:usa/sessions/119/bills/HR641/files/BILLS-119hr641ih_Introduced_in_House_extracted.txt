Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Coordination for Soil Carbon Research and Monitoring Act.

Section 2:
2.Soil carbon research and monitoring (a)Interagency committee (1)In generalThere is established an interagency committee to be known as the Interagency Committee on Soil Carbon Research (in this section referred to as the Interagency Committee), to be led by the Office of Science and Technology Policy and composed of representatives from the following: 
(A)The Department of Agriculture. (B)The Department of Energy. 
(C)The Department of the Interior. (D)The Environmental Protection Agency. 
(E)The United States Geological Survey. (F)The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
(G)The National Science Foundation. (H)The National Aeronautics and Space Administration. 
(I)The White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council. (J)The National Institute of Standards and Technology. 
(K)Such other Federal agencies as the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy determines appropriate. (2)DutiesThe Interagency Committee shall— 
(A)develop a cross-agency strategic plan for Federal research, development, and deployment regarding soil carbon sequestration sampling and measurement methodologies, measurement and monitoring technologies, and community needs; (B)propose roles and responsibilities to each Federal agency to advance soil carbon sequestration research and monitoring; 
(C)oversee working groups established under this section; (D)as appropriate, seek to consult with Federal agencies and with the Office of Management and Budget regarding planning and budget review, respectively, concerning matters relating to Federal soil carbon sequestration research and monitoring; 
(E)not later than one year after the date of the enactment of this Act, submit to Congress a baseline report on existing soil carbon sequestration research and monitoring activities; (F)submit to Congress progress reports on soil carbon sequestration research and monitoring activities at one-, three-, and five-year intervals after the submission of the baseline report under subparagraph (E); 
(G)encourage coordination between Federal agencies and evaluate soil carbon sequestration monitoring activities, data collection on soil carbon and greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes, and long-term storage protocols for soil carbon; (H)support comprehensive reporting on soil carbon sequestration related activities based on a standardized integration of existing and new relevant data collection efforts across Federal agencies; 
(I)share recommendations for review and input with soil science experts from academia, private industry, and nonprofit organizations that represent the geographic, operational, and demographic diversity of United States agriculture; and (J)designate a member of the Interagency Committee to collaborate with Federal agency heads on soil carbon sequestration research and monitoring activities. 
(3)Working groups 
(A)In generalThe Interagency Committee may, as appropriate and necessary, establish working groups to coordinate on cross-cutting priorities on soil carbon research as determined by the Interagency Committee, including relating to the following: (i)Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV). 
(ii)Data collection and management, with a focus on measurement standards, standards for use of new technologies, and data architecture for accessibility across agencies. (iii)Fundamental research, including regarding soil carbon dynamics, plant breeding, and soil amendments. 
(iv)Community engagement in research development and dissemination of results, particularly with historically underserved and disadvantaged groups. (B)DutiesWorking groups established pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall— 
(i)identify ongoing research and monitoring efforts on soil carbon at each Federal agency represented in each such working group; (ii)identify gaps in current efforts on soil carbon sequestration research and monitoring; 
(iii)outline current collaboration across agencies on soil carbon sequestration research and monitoring; (iv)propose coordinated projects and budget requests to advance the field of soil carbon sequestration research and monitoring; 
(v)engage with and conduct outreach to agricultural communities and producers, particularly those historically underserved, to ensure soil carbon sequestration research and monitoring is rooted in stakeholder engagement and on-the-ground perspectives; (vi)engage with research and extension soil scientists, private industry, nonprofit organizations, and other interdisciplinary soil science expert groups to ensure that recommendations are informed by the best available science; and 
(vii)collaborate on the development of standardized monitoring of the long-term carbon and environmental impacts of soil carbon sequestration research. (b)Authorization of appropriationsThere is authorized to be appropriated $10,000,000 to carry out this section.
