IV119th CONGRESS1st SessionH. RES. 298IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESApril 7, 2025Mr. Thanedar (for himself, Mr. Carson, Ms. Norton, and Mr. Evans of Pennsylvania) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and CommerceRESOLUTIONExpressing support for the designation of April 7, 2025, as World Health Day and recognizing the importance of prioritizing public health nationally and globally. 
Whereas the cost of and access to health care have been the two most serious issues in the health care system of the United States for 25 years; Whereas the lack of attention devoted to public health has detrimental effects on the social and economic stability of the Nation; 
Whereas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, life expectancy in the United States has been declining since 2019; Whereas increased maternal and infant mortality are among the causes of the declining life expectancy; 
Whereas the World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes April 7, 2025, as World Health Day, and its theme, Healthy Beginnings, Hopeful Futures, which will start a yearlong campaign on maternal and newborn health; Whereas women and families deserve high-quality health care that supports them physically and mentally before, during, and after birth; 
Whereas health systems must evolve to manage the many health issues that impact maternal and newborn health; Whereas health systems must also evolve to manage the many health issues that impact marginalized and historically disadvantaged communities; 
Whereas the lack of access to high-quality health care most heavily affects children, seniors, and people of color, particularly in the poorest and most marginalized communities; Whereas the underrepresentation of people of color in clinical trials exacerbates racial and ethnic disparities and limits access to potentially lifesaving treatments; 
Whereas the labor of health care workers and caretakers must be recognized as a cornerstone of the health and well-being of our communities; Whereas, according to the WHO, up to 38 percent of health care workers worldwide have experienced physical violence, and these critical workers must be protected as they administer lifesaving care; 
Whereas health includes not only physical health but also mental health; Whereas physical health and mental health are inextricably linked; 
Whereas the lack of access to mental health services and the stigma associated with having mental health conditions discourage individuals with mental health conditions from seeking lifesaving help; Whereas governments and societies should prioritize investing in the promotion, protection, and care of the health of individuals and their caregivers; 
Whereas health and support services should have an emphasis on ensuring and providing affordable, high-quality access to health care that meets the needs of children, adolescents, adults, and seniors; and Whereas April 7, 2025, is an appropriate day to designate as World Health Day, as the day is recognized internationally and supported by the WHO: Now, therefore, be it 
That the House of Representatives— (1)expresses support for the designation of World Health Day; 
(2)acknowledges that no single health care program or effort will be appropriate for all populations or communities; (3)recognizes that children, seniors, and people of color, particularly in the poorest and most marginalized communities, are most heavily impacted by the lack of access to quality health care; and 
(4)recognizes that interagency coordination and collaboration are essential to ensuring the well-being of children and their ability to develop, survive, and thrive.
