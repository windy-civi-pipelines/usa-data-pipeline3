 as appropriate, respect regional architectural heritage;    (2) designs for applicable Federal public buildings should be selected with substantial input from the local community;
            
            
                (3)
 architecture, particularly traditional architecture and classical architecture, that meets the criteria described in paragraph (1) is the preferred architecture for applicable Federal public buildings;

                (6)
 when renovating, reducing, or expanding applicable Federal public buildings that do not meet the criteria described in paragraph (1), the feasibility and potential expense of building redesign to meet that criteria should be examined; and

 where feasible and economical, a redesign described in paragraph (6) should be given substantial consideration, especially with respect to the exterior of the applicable Federal public building.
