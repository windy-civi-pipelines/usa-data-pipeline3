Section 1:
1.
            Short title
 This Act may be cited as the Global Respect Act of 2025.

Section 2:
2.
            Findings
 Congress makes the following findings:  (1) The dignity, freedom, and equality of all human beings are fundamental to a thriving global community.
            
            
                (2)
 The rights to life, liberty, and security of the person, the right to privacy, and the right to freedom of expression and association are fundamental human rights.
            
            
                (3)
 Many countries have made and are making positive developments in the protection of the basic human rights of LGBQTI individuals.
            
            
                (4)
 The alarming trend of increasing violence directed at lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (commonly referred to as LGBTQI) individuals around the world continues.
            
            
                (5)
 Approximately 1/3 of all countries have laws criminalizing consensual same-sex relations, and 12 countries carry the possibility of the death penalty.
            
            
                (6)
 Laws criminalizing consensual same-sex relations severely hinder access to HIV/AIDS treatment, information, and prevention measures for LGBTQI individuals and families.
            
            
                (7)
 Celebrations of LGBTQI individuals and communities, such as film festivals, Pride events, and demonstrations, are often forced underground due to inaction on the part of, or harassment by, local law enforcement and government officials, in violation of freedoms of assembly and expression.
            
            
                (8)
 Every year, countless individuals around the world are targeted for discrimination, harassment, arbitrary arrest and detention, physical attack, and murder on the basis of their actual or perceived sexual orientation, gender identity, or sex characteristics.
            
            
                (9)
 Those who commit crimes against LGBTQI individuals often do so with impunity, and are not held accountable for their crimes.
            
            
                (10)
 Homophobic and transphobic statements by government officials in many countries in every region of the world promote negative public attitudes and can lead to increased discrimination and violence toward LGBTQI individuals.
            
            
                (11)
 In many instances, police, prison, military, and civilian government authorities have been directly complicit in abuses aimed at LGBTQI citizens, including arbitrary arrest, extortion, cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, torture, and sexual abuse.

Section 3:

                (2)
                Appropriate congressional committees
 The term appropriate congressional committees means the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives.
            
            
                (3)

                    (B)

        IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
        
            June 26 (legislative day, June 24),
                2025
            Mrs. Shaheen (for herself, Ms. Murkowski, Mr.
                    Murphy, Mr. Van Hollen,
                    Mr. Merkley, Mr.

                    Schatz, Ms. Baldwin, and
                    Mr. Wyden) introduced the following bill;
                which was read twice and referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations
        
        A BILL
        To impose sanctions with respect to foreign persons responsible for
            violations of the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and
            intersex (LGBTQI) individuals, and for other purposes.
    
    
        
            1.
            Short title
 This Act may be cited as the Global Respect Act of 2025.
        
        
            2.
            Findings
 Congress makes the following findings:  (1) The dignity, freedom, and equality of all human beings are fundamental to a thriving global community.
            
            
                (2)
 The rights to life, liberty, and security of the person, the right to privacy, and the right to freedom of expression and association are fundamental human rights.
            
            
                (3)
 Many countries have made and are making positive developments in the protection of the basic human rights of LGBQTI individuals.
            
            
                (4)
 The alarming trend of increasing violence directed at lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (commonly referred to as LGBTQI) individuals around the world continues.
            
            
                (5)
 Approximately 1/3 of all countries have laws criminalizing consensual same-sex relations, and 12 countries carry the possibility of the death penalty.
            
            
                (6)
 Laws criminalizing consensual same-sex relations severely hinder access to HIV/AIDS treatment, information, and prevention measures for LGBTQI individuals and families.
            
            
                (7)
 Celebrations of LGBTQI individuals and communities, such as film festivals, Pride events, and demonstrations, are often forced underground due to inaction on the part of, or harassment by, local law enforcement and government officials, in violation of freedoms of assembly and expression.
            
            
                (8)
 Every year, countless individuals around the world are targeted for discrimination, harassment, arbitrary arrest and detention, physical attack, and murder on the basis of their actual or perceived sexual orientation, gender identity, or sex characteristics.
            
            
                (9)
 Those who commit crimes against LGBTQI individuals often do so with impunity, and are not held accountable for their crimes.
            
            
                (10)
 Homophobic and transphobic statements by government officials in many countries in every region of the world promote negative public attitudes and can lead to increased discrimination and violence toward LGBTQI individuals.
            
            
                (11)
 In many instances, police, prison, military, and civilian government authorities have been directly complicit in abuses aimed at LGBTQI citizens, including arbitrary arrest, extortion, cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, torture, and sexual abuse.
