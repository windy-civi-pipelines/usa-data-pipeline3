Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Tribal Access to Clean Water Act of 2025.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds that— 
(1)access to reliable, clean, and drinkable water is an essential human need and critical to the public health, well-being, educational attainment, and economic development of all communities in the United States; (2)many countries, along with the United Nations, have recognized the urgency of the need to access reliable, clean, and drinkable water by passing laws or resolutions relating to the human right to water and sanitation, including— 
(A)recognizing these water and sanitation needs exist among indigenous peoples; and (B)establishing aggressive targets for achieving universal access to those basic services; 
(3)in the United States, access to reliable, clean, and drinkable water has long been a significant problem in many communities on Tribal lands, such that nearly half of all households on Tribal lands do not have access to reliable water sources, clean drinking water, or basic sanitation, and are significantly more likely than other households in the United States to lack indoor plumbing; (4)the first of the 5 pillars announced on February 4, 2025, by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency Lee Zeldin that will guide the work of the Environmental Protection Agency under the Powering the Great American Comeback Initiative is the principle that every American should have access to clean air, land, and water; 
(5)the trust responsibility of the Federal Government to Indian Tribes and the Native Hawaiian Community requires the Federal Government to ensure the survival and welfare of Indian Tribes and the Native Hawaiian Community, and the failure to provide basic water service cannot be reconciled with that trust responsibility; (6)the public health of Indian Tribes and the Native Hawaiian Community lags behind other communities in the United States at least in part as a result of lack of public health infrastructure, including access to running water; 
(7)through the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Public Law 117–58; 135 Stat. 429), Congress provided funding for the Indian Health Service and the Environmental Protection Agency to support the construction and repair of Tribal clean water infrastructure, but— (A)inadequate resources are available to Indian Tribes to assist with accessing those construction and repair funding programs and to support the operation and maintenance of water infrastructure; and 
(B)much of that funding is unavailable to the Native Hawaiian Community; (8)filling the gaps in funding described in paragraph (7) is necessary for efficient implementation of the historic investment in clean water infrastructure for Indian Tribes and the Native Hawaiian Community; 
(9)technical assistance to Indian Tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations is necessary to ensure that Indian Tribes and the Native Hawaiian Community are able— (A)to access and take advantage of the new funding described in paragraph (7); 
(B)to develop the managerial, financial, and regulatory framework necessary for a fully functional and self-sustaining utility; and (C)to engage appropriate outside consultants to assist as needed; 
(10)advances in water technology, including treatment, sensors, and innovative pipeline materials, can assist in— (A)accelerating efforts to provide universal access to reliable, clean, and drinkable water on Tribal lands; and 
(B)enhancing resilience in the face of extreme weather events; (11)past epidemics of communicable diseases and the threat of future such occurrences are stark reminders that access to reliable, clean, and drinkable water to support basic health is a matter of life or death for all individuals in the United States; 
(12)it is in the interest of the United States, and it is the policy of the United States, that all Tribal lands be provided with safe and adequate water supply systems as soon as practicable; and (13)both appropriate funding at the level of unmet need and a whole of government approach among all Federal agencies are essential to provide a meaningful solution to the lack of access to clean water on Tribal lands.
