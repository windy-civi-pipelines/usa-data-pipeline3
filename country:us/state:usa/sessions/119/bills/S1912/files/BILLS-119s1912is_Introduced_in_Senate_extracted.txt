Section 1:

            Short title
 This Act may be cited as the Protecting Veteran Community Care Act.

Section 2:
2.
            Findings
 Congress finds the following:  (1) On June 6, 2018, the John S. McCain III, Daniel K. Akaka, and Samuel R. Johnson VA Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks Act of 2018 (Public Law 115–182) (in this section referred to as the VA MISSION Act) became law.
            
            
                (2)
 Congressional intent with the VA MISSION Act was to reform and replace the program under section 101 of the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 (Public Law 113–146; 38 U.S.C. 1701 note) to ensure access of veterans to community health care providers.
            
            
                (3)
 The eligibility standards established by the VA MISSION Act were not meant to be used to limit health care options for veterans or to be applied to community providers, which would result in reduced health care options.
            
            
                (4)
 Many veterans do not have access to a medical facility of the Department of Veterans Affairs in their community and each medical facility of the Department may not be able to adequately address the specific health care needs of a particular veteran.
            
            
                (5)
 It was intent of Congress in the VA MISSION Act that all medical services, including mental health treatments and institutional extended care services for mental health, were to be available to veterans in the community.
            
            
                (6)
 The Department is limiting access of veterans to community care for mental health treatments.
            
            
                (7)
 Despite the best efforts of the Department, veteran suicide remains at significant levels throughout the United States.
            
            
                (8)
 No veteran should have to wait 30 days for mental health services to be approved by the Department.
            
            
                (9)
 Telehealth appointments represent a valuable complementary health care option for underserved veterans, but do not offer the same quality of care as in-person visits to facilities of the Department or in the community for veterans in crisis.

Section 3:

            Expansion of Veterans Community Care Program to include access to mental health
                or substance-use services for veterans unable to timely access Mental Health

                                        (i)

                        (B)
 by adding at the end the following new paragraph (5):   (5) In the case of a covered veteran entitled to mental health or substance-use services under paragraph (1)(F), the Secretary shall ensure that referral of a veteran to an alternate Mental Health Residential Rehabilitation Treatment Program of the Department does not take precedence over timely access to such services under this section pursuant to such paragraph unless such referral is requested by the covered veteran.
                            
                            ;
