Whereas the profession of linemen is steeped in personal, family, and professional tradition; Whereas linemen are often first responders during storms and other catastrophic events, working to make the scene safe for other public safety heroes; 
Whereas linemen must work high atop powerlines 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to keep electricity flowing; Whereas linemen play a vital role in the Nation’s economy by maintaining and growing the energy infrastructure of the United States; 
Whereas linemen must often work under dangerous conditions separated from their families to keep schools and businesses open; Whereas linemen deserve recognition from the community regarding the danger of their work; and 
Whereas, April 18, 2025, would be an appropriate date to designate as National Lineman Appreciation Day: Now, therefore, be it That the House of Representatives—
(1)recognizes the efforts of linemen in keeping the power on and protecting public safety; (2)supports the designation of National Lineman Appreciation Day; and
(3)recognizes linemen as first responders.
