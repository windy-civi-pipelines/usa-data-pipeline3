RES. 470IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESJune 4, 2025Mr. Bera (for himself, Mrs. Kim, Mr. Moylan, Ms. Salazar, Ms. Norton, Mrs. Radewagen, Mr. Moulton, Mr. Krishnamoorthi, Mr. Wilson of South Carolina, Mr. Self, Mr. McCormick, Mr. Dunn of Florida, Mr. Moolenaar, Mr. Bell, Mr. Lawler, Ms. Tokuda, Ms. Titus, Mr. Issa, and Mr. Meeks) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign AffairsRESOLUTIONRemembering the victims of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre and condemning the continued and intensifying crackdown on human rights and basic freedoms within the People’s Republic of China, including the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, by the Chinese Communist Party, and for other purposes. 
Whereas, on April 15, 1989, peaceful demonstrators gathered in Tiananmen Square in central Beijing to mourn the death of former General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Hu Yaobang, who was compelled to resign in 1987 for supporting political reforms within the CCP; Whereas, throughout April and May 1989, peaceful demonstrations continued in Tiananmen Square and in an estimated 400 cities across China; 
Whereas, by May 17, 1989, an estimated 1,000,000 Chinese citizens from all walks of life, including students, government employees, journalists, workers, police officers, and members of the Armed Forces, gathered peacefully in Tiananmen Square to call for democratic reforms; Whereas the peaceful demonstrators of 1989 called upon the Government of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) to eliminate corruption, accelerate economic and political reform, and protect human rights, particularly the freedoms of expression and assembly; 
Whereas, on May 20, 1989, the Government of the PRC declared martial law; Whereas during the late afternoon and early evening hours of June 3, 1989, the CCP leadership sent armed People’s Liberation Army (PLA) troops and tanks into Beijing and surrounding areas; 
Whereas, on the night of June 3 and continuing into the morning of June 4, 1989, PLA soldiers proceeded to Tiananmen Square, at the direction of CCP leadership, and fired indiscriminately into crowds of peaceful protesters, killing and injuring thousands of demonstrators and other unarmed civilians; Whereas the Government of the PRC continues to censor any mention of the crackdown centered on Tiananmen Square, prevents the victims from being publicly mourned and remembered, and harasses, detains, and arrests those who call for a full, public, and independent accounting of the wounded, dead, and those imprisoned for participating in the spring 1989 demonstrations; 
Whereas the sovereignty of Hong Kong transferred from the United Kingdom to the PRC in 1997 under the terms of the Joint Declaration of the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the People’s Republic of China on the Question of Hong Kong (hereafter the Joint Declaration), which guaranteed the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) will enjoy a high degree of autonomy, and committed the PRC to keep the social and economic systems in Hong Kong unchanged through 2047; Whereas the Joint Declaration states that Rights and freedoms, including those of the person, of speech, of the press, of assembly, of association, of travel, of movement, of correspondence, of strike, of choice of occupation, of academic research and of religious belief will be ensured by law in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and that those rights are reiterated in Chapter III of the Basic Law of the HKSAR of the PRC; 
Whereas the people of Hong Kong had held an annual Tiananmen Square vigil since 1990 and has been the only such mass gathering on Chinese territory because commemorations are banned in mainland China; Whereas, on June 4, 2020, thousands of people in Hong Kong defied Hong Kong authorities and gathered at the city’s annual June 4 vigil to memorialize the 31st anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre; 
Whereas, on June 30, 2020, China’s National People’s Congress Standing Committee flagrantly undermined the high degree of autonomy promised to Hong Kong in the Joint Declaration and Basic Law by passing and imposing upon Hong Kong the oppressive and intentionally vague Law of the PRC on Safeguarding National Security in the HKSAR (national security law); Whereas the central Government of the PRC and the HKSAR Government have since used the national security law to suppress democratic voices in Hong Kong, including by barring candidates from standing for election and by arresting prodemocracy activists and opposition leaders; 
Whereas, on March 11, 2021, China’s National People’s Congress adopted the Decision of the National People’s Congress on Improving the Electoral System of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, thereby further restricting Hong Kong’s electoral freedom and democratic representation; Whereas, on May 27, 2021, the Hong Kong Police Force withheld permits for the June 4 vigil for the second consecutive year, citing a ban on large gatherings in light of the coronavirus pandemic; 
Whereas permits were continuously withheld through 2024 despite the pandemic restrictions being removed in Hong Kong; Whereas, on May 27, 2021, the Hong Kong Legislative Council passed legislation amending local election laws to bring them in line with the China’s National People’s Congress March 11 Decision of the National People’s Congress on Improving the Electoral System of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region; 
Whereas, on March 4, 2023, the HKSAR West Kowloon Magistrates’ Court convicted three standing committee members of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, Chow Hang-tung, Tang Ngok-kwan, and Tsui Hon-kwong, under the National Security Law, and the Alliance was an organizer of the annual Tiananmen vigil; Whereas, on March 23, 2024, the Government of the HKSAR promulgated the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance that allows police to apply for extended pretrial detention, restrictions on suspects’ consultation with legal representatives, and restrictions on bail for certain national security cases, and lists several offenses as having extraterritorial effect on Hong Kong residents for activities outside the HKSAR; 
Whereas, June 4, 2025, marks the 36th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre; Whereas the Government of the PRC has committed genocide and crimes against humanity against the predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang; and 
Whereas the Government of the PRC continues to violate the human rights of prodemocracy activists, members of ethnic minorities, including individuals in the Tibetan regions, religious believers, human rights lawyers, citizen journalists, and labor union leaders, among many others seeking to express their political or religious views or ethnic identity in a peaceful manner: Now, therefore, be it That the House of Representatives— 
(1)expresses its deepest respect for and solidarity with the families and friends of those killed, tortured, and imprisoned for participating in the prodemocracy demonstrations during the spring of 1989, and with those who have continued to suffer for their fight to publicly mourn the Tiananmen Square massacre victims; (2)reaffirms its support for those who continue to work for political reform, rule of law, and protections for human rights in China;

(5)calls on the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and the relevant authorities in the Government of the PRC to— (A)respect and uphold the personal rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong and the independence of Hong Kong’s legal system;

(6)calls on the United States Government and Members of Congress to mark the 36th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests, including through meetings with participants of the Tiananmen Square protests who live outside of China and the families and friends of the victims of the Tiananmen Square massacre based outside China; and (7)supports ongoing peaceful movements for human rights in China and of the people in Hong Kong, Tibet, and Xinjiang.
