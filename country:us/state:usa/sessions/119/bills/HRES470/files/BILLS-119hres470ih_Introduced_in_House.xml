<whereas><text>Whereas, by May 17, 1989, an estimated 1,000,000 Chinese citizens from all walks of life, including students, government employees, journalists, workers, police officers, and members of the Armed Forces, gathered peacefully in Tiananmen Square to call for democratic reforms;</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas the peaceful demonstrators of 1989 called upon the Government of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) to eliminate corruption, accelerate economic and political reform, and protect human rights, particularly the freedoms of expression and assembly;</text></whereas> 
<whereas><text>Whereas, on May 20, 1989, the Government of the PRC declared martial law;</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas during the late afternoon and early evening hours of June 3, 1989, the CCP leadership sent armed People’s Liberation Army (PLA) troops and tanks into Beijing and surrounding areas;</text></whereas> 
<whereas><text>Whereas, on the night of June 3 and continuing into the morning of June 4, 1989, PLA soldiers proceeded to Tiananmen Square, at the direction of CCP leadership, and fired indiscriminately into crowds of peaceful protesters, killing and injuring thousands of demonstrators and other unarmed civilians;</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas the Government of the PRC continues to censor any mention of the crackdown centered on Tiananmen Square, prevents the victims from being publicly mourned and remembered, and harasses, detains, and arrests those who call for a full, public, and independent accounting of the wounded, dead, and those imprisoned for participating in the spring 1989 demonstrations;</text></whereas> 
<whereas><text>Whereas the sovereignty of Hong Kong transferred from the United Kingdom to the PRC in 1997 under the terms of the Joint Declaration of the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the People’s Republic of China on the Question of Hong Kong (hereafter the <quote>Joint Declaration</quote>), which guaranteed the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) will <quote>enjoy a high degree of autonomy</quote>, and committed the PRC to keep the <quote>social and economic systems in Hong Kong</quote> unchanged through 2047;</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas the Joint Declaration states that <quote>Rights and freedoms, including those of the person, of speech, of the press, of assembly, of association, of travel, of movement, of correspondence, of strike, of choice of occupation, of academic research and of religious belief will be ensured by law in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region</quote> and that those rights are reiterated in Chapter III of the Basic Law of the HKSAR of the PRC;</text></whereas> 
<whereas><text>Whereas the people of Hong Kong had held an annual Tiananmen Square vigil since 1990 and has been the only such mass gathering on Chinese territory because commemorations are banned in mainland China;</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas, on June 4, 2020, thousands of people in Hong Kong defied Hong Kong authorities and gathered at the city’s annual June 4 vigil to memorialize the 31st anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre;</text></whereas> 
<whereas><text>Whereas, on June 30, 2020, China’s National People’s Congress Standing Committee flagrantly undermined the high degree of autonomy promised to Hong Kong in the Joint Declaration and Basic Law by passing and imposing upon Hong Kong the oppressive and intentionally vague Law of the PRC on Safeguarding National Security in the HKSAR (<quote>national security law</quote>);</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas the central Government of the PRC and the HKSAR Government have since used the national security law to suppress democratic voices in Hong Kong, including by barring candidates from standing for election and by arresting prodemocracy activists and opposition leaders;</text></whereas> 
<whereas><text>Whereas, on March 11, 2021, China’s National People’s Congress adopted the <quote>Decision of the National People’s Congress on Improving the Electoral System of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region</quote>, thereby further restricting Hong Kong’s electoral freedom and democratic representation;</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas, on May 27, 2021, the Hong Kong Police Force withheld permits for the June 4 vigil for the second consecutive year, citing a ban on large gatherings in light of the coronavirus pandemic;</text></whereas>

<whereas><text>Whereas, June 4, 2025, marks the 36th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre;</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas the Government of the PRC has committed genocide and crimes against humanity against the predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang; and</text></whereas>
