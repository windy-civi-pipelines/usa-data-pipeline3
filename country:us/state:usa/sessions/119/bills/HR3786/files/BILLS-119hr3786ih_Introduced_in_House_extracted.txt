Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Drones for First Responders Act.

Section 2:
2.Findings and sense of Congress (a)FindingsCongress makes the following findings: 
(1)Unmanned aircraft that are made in the People’s Republic of China dominate the current market in the United States for unmanned aircraft and present an unacceptable national security risk. (2)Through direct subsidization and targeted investment by the Chinese Communist Party, unmanned aircraft suppliers in the People’s Republic of China are undercutting the domestic and partnered unmanned aircraft markets and undermining ad valorem tariffs. 
(3)Over 90 percent of unmanned aircraft operated by America’s first responders are made in the People’s Republic of China. (4)It is strategically critical for first responders, critical infrastructure providers, and farmers and ranchers to have access to secure unmanned aircraft that are manufactured in the United States or by our partners and allies. 
(5)The United States cannot rely on the People’s Republic of China to supply unmanned aircraft that are critical to first responder operations. (6)It is vital to the national security of the United States that unmanned aircraft manufacturers of the United States and our partners and allies are competitive with Chinese unmanned aircraft manufacturers. 
(7)The United States has a national security interest in securing the supply chain for unmanned aircraft to the domestic market, allies, and free trade partners. (8)Implementing tariffs on unmanned aircraft from the People’s Republic of China has the effect of incentivizing sourcing domestically and in allied and partnered countries, which in turn has the effect of promoting resilient supply chains. 
(b)Sense of CongressIt is the sense of Congress that phasing-in a protective specific duty for unmanned aircraft is prudent and necessary to safeguard this critical industry and increase the competitiveness of the unmanned aircraft industry outside of the People’s Republic of China.
