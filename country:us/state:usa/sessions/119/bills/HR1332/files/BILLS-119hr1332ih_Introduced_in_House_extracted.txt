Section 2:
2.Aquatic species genome sequencing program (a)In generalThe Secretary shall establish and carry out a program to sequence the genomes of aquatic species, in coordination with covered entities, to enhance scientific understanding and conservation, management, and enforcement efforts with respect to such species. 
(b)Program dutiesIn carrying out the Program, the Secretary shall carry out activities that include the following: (1)Identify and catalogue vouchered specimens, verifiably identified by a taxonomist, of aquatic species held by covered entities for the purpose of including such aquatic species in the Program. 
(2)Obtain genetic samples, including through purchase or field collection, of priority species. (3)Extract and process DNA from samples of aquatic species or the environment through laboratory analysis, including carrying out any labor and acquiring any supplies required for such analysis. 
(4)Sequence the genomes of aquatic species to accepted completeness and quality standards for reference genomes, including, as the Secretary determines appropriate, nuclear, mitochondrial, and chloroplast DNA. (5)Collect, catalogue, and store the metadata created by sequencing the genomes of aquatic species under paragraph (4). 
(6)Make publicly available the genomes and associated metadata of aquatic species that have been sequenced but are not publicly available. (7)Provide funding and technical assistance to covered entities that the Secretary determines appropriate to carry out the activities described in paragraphs (1) through (6). 
(8)Establish principles for the management and sharing of data collected and produced through the Program in accordance with the document titled The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship (published March 15, 2016). (c)Program participation by covered entitiesA covered entity may carry out the activities described in paragraphs (1) through (6) of subsection (b) pursuant to the Program. 
(d)Data sharing 
(1)In generalExcept as provided in paragraph (2), if the Secretary or a covered entity sequences the genome of an aquatic species pursuant to the Program, not later than 360 days after the date on which the sequencing of such genome is completed, the Secretary or the covered entity that sequenced such genome, as applicable, shall submit to the National Center for Biotechnology Information to make publicly available such sequenced genome and any associated raw sequence data and metadata, including— (A)the species of such genome; 
(B)the location of where the sample that was used to sequence such genome was collected; (C)the time and date of when such sample was collected; 
(D)the process by which such genome was sequenced; and (E)any information required pursuant to the principles for the management and sharing of data collected and produced through the Program established under subsection (b)(8). 
(2)Exception for Tribal governmentsIf, pursuant to the Program, a Tribal Government sequences the genome of an aquatic species or provides a sample of an aquatic species to the Secretary that the Secretary uses to sequence the genome of such species, the Tribal Government shall be the only entity with the authority to determine whether and when to submit to the National Center for Biotechnology Information to make publicly available the data collected and produced through such sequencing. (e)Authorization of appropriationsThere is authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary to carry out the Program $2,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2025 through 2031.

(iv)a macroinvertebrate that acts as a biological indicator of aquatic ecosystem health; (v)a species that contributes to harmful algal blooms or a foodborne illness derived from eating seafood; 
(vi)a species of fish that is managed pursuant to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801); (vii)an aquatic species of greatest conservation need;
