 Whereas hazing is any intentional, knowing, or reckless act committed by a person, whether individually or in concert with other persons, against another person regardless of the willingness of that person to participate, that—
            
                (1)
 is committed in the course of an initiation into, an affiliation with, or the maintenance of membership in a student organization; and

 Whereas 55 percent of college students involved in extracurricular clubs, athletic teams, and organizations reported experiencing hazing;
        
        
 Whereas a hazing prevention policy is vital to help shape expectations for safe campus communities where healthy group behaviors, ethical leadership, and feelings of positive well-being and belonging are fostered;
        
        
 Whereas the Stop Campus Hazing Act (Public Law 118–173; 138 Stat. 2597) was signed into law in December 2024 to enhance hazing prevention efforts on college campuses by requiring institutions of higher education to include hazing incidents in their annual security reports, provide hazing prevention education, and report findings of responsibility for campus hazing policy violations in a Campus Hazing Transparency Report, thereby ensuring greater transparency and accountability in addressing hazing nationwide;

 Whereas hazing has a lasting, harmful, and deadly impact, and preventing hazing must be prioritized: Now, therefore, be it
        
    
    
        
            
 That the Senate—  (1) supports the designation of the week of September 22 through September 26, 2025, as National Hazing Awareness Week;
