(aa)Equipment for photolithography, including photomasks. (bb)Software. 
(II)The processes for such manufacturing and research, including the following: (aa)Designing. 
(bb)Packaging. (III)The minerals, gases, and other chemical substances utilized in such manufacturing and research. 
(IV)The supply chains for such minerals, gases, and substances.  (ii)The trends with respect to the following: 
(I)The offshoring of such manufacturing and research from January 1, 1990, to such date of enactment. (II)Any reshoring of such offshored manufacturing and research. 
(III)Partnerships between domestic entities and foreign entities for such inputs. (IV)Investments by such entities for the domestic manufacturing of, and research relating to, such semiconductors and technologies.
