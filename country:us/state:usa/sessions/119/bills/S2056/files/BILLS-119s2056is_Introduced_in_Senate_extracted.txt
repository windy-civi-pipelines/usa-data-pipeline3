                                    (B)

                                    (B)
 not treated as expenses under subsection (a), and   (C) chargeable to capital account but not chargeable to property of a character which is subject to the allowance under section 167 (relating to allowance for depreciation, etc.) or section 611 (relating to allowance for depletion),

                                    treated as deferred expenses. In computing taxable income, such
                                    deferred expenses shall be allowed as a deduction ratably over

                                    taxpayer (beginning with the month in which the taxpayer first
                                    realizes benefits from such expenditures). Such deferred

The method so elected, and the period selected by the taxpayer, shall be adhered to in computing taxable income for the taxable year for which the election is made and for all subsequent taxable years unless, with the approval of the Secretary, a change to a different method (or to a different period) is authorized with respect to part or all of such expenditures. The election shall not apply to any expenditure paid or incurred during any taxable year before the taxable year for which the taxpayer makes the election.
