RESOLUTION
Recognizing the 20th anniversary of the Children’s Hospital Association’s Family Advocacy Day and honoring the contributions of children’s hospitals and their patients and families.


Whereas pediatric health care is essential to ensuring the healthy development of children from infancy through adolescence to adulthood;  Whereas investment in child health improves outcomes for children and reduces the burden of chronic disease throughout the lifespan;
Whereas children’s health care providers receive specialized training and develop unique expertise, to provide care that meets children’s unique physical, emotional and developmental needs;  Whereas the Children’s Hospital Association (CHA) serves as the national voice for more than 200 children’s hospitals, and these hospitals provide specialized care to millions of children across the United States;
Whereas for the past 20 years, the Children’s Hospital Association’s Family Advocacy Day has brought together pediatric patients and their families from across the country to share their personal health care stories with lawmakers in Washington, DC; Whereas Family Advocacy Day underscores the urgent need to protect and strengthen the pediatric health care system, support investments in the pediatric workforce, and expand access to care for children with complex medical conditions;
Whereas children’s hospitals play a vital role in advancing pediatric health by providing the highest-quality clinical care, training the next generation of pediatric specialists, and leading critical pediatric research and innovation; Whereas children’s hospitals prioritize children’s mental and emotional health, through training pediatric behavioral health professionals and delivering a wide range of mental and behavioral health services to support children and families;
Whereas CHA’s advocacy priorities, including protecting access to care through Medicaid, addressing the youth mental health crisis, and strengthening the pediatric health care workforce, are central to improving the health and well-being of children nationwide; and Whereas the 20th anniversary theme, “Team CHA,” reflects the shared commitment of families, providers, hospitals, and lawmakers working together to create a better future for all children; Now, therefore, be it

That the House of Representatives— (1)honors the children and families who bravely share their stories to advocate for policies that strengthen pediatric care;
(2) commends the Children’s Hospital Association for 20 years of Family Advocacy Day and its continued dedication to improving pediatric health care; (3) recognizes the vital role of children’s hospitals in delivering specialized, family-centered care to children across the nation; and
(4) supports continued federal investment in pediatric health care to ensure every child has timely access to the highest quality care.
