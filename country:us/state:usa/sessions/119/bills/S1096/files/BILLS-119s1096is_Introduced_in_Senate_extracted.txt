Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Preserve Access to Affordable Generics and Biosimilars Act.

Section 2:
2.Congressional findings and declaration of purposes(a)FindingsCongress finds the following:(1)In 1984, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act (Public Law 98–417) (referred to in this Act as the 1984 Act), was enacted with the intent of facilitating the early entry of generic drugs while preserving incentives for innovation.(2)Prescription drugs make up approximately 11 percent of the national health care spending.(3)Initially, the 1984 Act was successful in facilitating generic competition to the benefit of consumers and health care payers. Although 91 percent of all prescriptions dispensed in the United States are generic drugs, they account for only 18 percent of all expenditures.(4)Generic drugs cost substantially less than brand name drugs, with discounts off the brand price averaging 80 to 85 percent.(5)Federal dollars currently account for over 40 percent of the $449,700,000,000 spent on retail prescription drugs annually.(6)(A)In recent years, the intent of the 1984 Act has been subverted by certain settlement agreements in which brand name companies transfer value to their potential generic competitors to settle claims that the generic company is infringing the branded company’s patents.(B)These reverse payment settlement agreements—(i)allow a branded company to share its monopoly profits with the generic company as a way to protect the branded company’s monopoly; and(ii)have unduly delayed the marketing of low-cost generic drugs contrary to free competition, the interests of consumers, and the principles underlying antitrust law.(C)Because of the price disparity between brand name and generic drugs, such agreements are more profitable for both the brand and generic manufacturers than competition and will become increasingly common unless prohibited.(D)These agreements result in consumers losing the benefits that the 1984 Act was intended to provide.(7)In 2010, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (Public Law 111–148) (referred to in this Act as the BPCIA), was enacted with the intent of facilitating the early entry of biosimilar and interchangeable follow-on versions of branded biological products while preserving incentives for innovation.(8)Biological drugs play an important role in treating many serious illnesses, from cancers to genetic disorders. They are also expensive, representing more than half of all prescription drug spending.(9)Competition from biosimilar and interchangeable biological products promises to lower drug costs and increase patient access to biological medicines. But reverse payment settlement agreements also threaten to delay the entry of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products, which would undermine the goals of BPCIA.(b)PurposesThe purposes of this Act are—(1)to enhance competition in the pharmaceutical market by stopping anticompetitive agreements between brand name and generic drug and biosimilar biological product manufacturers that limit, delay, or otherwise prevent competition from generic drugs and biosimilar biological products; and(2)to support the purpose and intent of antitrust law by prohibiting anticompetitive practices in the pharmaceutical industry that harm consumers.

Section 3:
3.Unlawful compensation for delay(a)In generalThe Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 44 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section 26 (15 U.S.C. 57c–2) the following:27.Preserving access to affordable generics and biosimilars(a)Prohibition(1)In generalIt shall be a violation of this section for a party to enter into, or be a participant to, an agreement, resolving or settling, on a final or interim basis, a patent claim in connection with the sale of a drug product or biological product, that has anticompetitive effects. (2)TreatmentA violation of this section shall be treated as an unfair method of competition in violation of section 5(a)(1).(3)Presumption(A)In generalSubject to subparagraph (B), an agreement described in paragraph (1) shall be presumed to have anticompetitive effects for purposes of such paragraph if—(i)an ANDA filer or a biosimilar biological product application filer receives anything of value, including an exclusive license; and(ii)the ANDA filer or biosimilar biological product application filer agrees to limit or forgo research, development, manufacturing, marketing, or sales of the ANDA product or biosimilar biological product, as applicable, for any period of time.(B)ExceptionSubparagraph (A) shall not apply if the parties to such agreement demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that—(i)the value described in subparagraph (A)(i) is compensation solely for other goods or services that the ANDA filer or biosimilar biological product application filer has promised to provide; or(ii)the procompetitive benefits of the transfer of value described in subparagraph (A)(i) and the agreement by the ANDA filer or biosimilar biological product application filer to limit or forgo research, development, manufacturing, marketing, or sales of the ANDA product or biosimilar biological product described in subparagraph (A)(ii) outweigh the anticompetitive effects of the transfer of value described in subparagraph (A)(i) and the agreement by the ANDA filer or biosimilar biological product application filer to limit or forgo research, development, manufacturing, marketing, or sales of the ANDA product or biosimilar biological product described in subparagraph (A)(ii).(4)Civil actionIn addition to any proceeding under section 5, if the Commission has reason to believe that a party has violated this section, the Commission may bring, in its own name by any of its attorneys designated by it for such purpose, a civil action against the party in a district court of the United States to seek to recover any of the remedies of civil penalty, mandatory injunctions, and such other and further equitable relief as the court deems appropriate.(5)Civil penalty(A)In generalEach party that violates or assists in the violation of paragraph (1) shall forfeit and pay to the United States a civil penalty sufficient to deter violations of paragraph (1), but in no event greater than 3 times the value received by the party that is reasonably attributable to the violation of paragraph (1).

Although 91 percent of all prescriptions dispensed in the United States are generic drugs, they account for only 18 percent of all expenditures.(4)Generic drugs cost substantially less than brand name drugs, with discounts off the brand price averaging 80 to 85 percent.(5)Federal dollars currently account for over 40 percent of the $449,700,000,000 spent on retail prescription drugs annually.(6)(A)In recent years, the intent of the 1984 Act has been subverted by certain settlement agreements in which brand name companies transfer value to their potential generic competitors to settle claims that the generic company is infringing the branded company’s patents.(B)These reverse payment settlement agreements—(i)allow a branded company to share its monopoly profits with the generic company as a way to protect the branded company’s monopoly; and(ii)have unduly delayed the marketing of low-cost generic drugs contrary to free competition, the interests of consumers, and the principles underlying antitrust law.(C)Because of the price disparity between brand name and generic drugs, such agreements are more profitable for both the brand and generic manufacturers than competition and will become increasingly common unless prohibited.(D)These agreements result in consumers losing the benefits that the 1984 Act was intended to provide.(7)In 2010, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (Public Law 111–148) (referred to in this Act as the BPCIA), was enacted with the intent of facilitating the early entry of biosimilar and interchangeable follow-on versions of branded biological products while preserving incentives for innovation.(8)Biological drugs play an important role in treating many serious illnesses, from cancers to genetic disorders. They are also expensive, representing more than half of all prescription drug spending.(9)Competition from biosimilar and interchangeable biological products promises to lower drug costs and increase patient access to biological medicines. But reverse payment settlement agreements also threaten to delay the entry of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products, which would undermine the goals of BPCIA.(b)PurposesThe purposes of this Act are—(1)to enhance competition in the pharmaceutical market by stopping anticompetitive agreements between brand name and generic drug and biosimilar biological product manufacturers that limit, delay, or otherwise prevent competition from generic drugs and biosimilar biological products; and(2)to support the purpose and intent of antitrust law by prohibiting anticompetitive practices in the pharmaceutical industry that harm consumers.3.Unlawful compensation for delay(a)In generalThe Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 44 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section 26 (15 U.S.C. 57c–2) the following:27.Preserving access to affordable generics and biosimilars(a)Prohibition(1)In generalIt shall be a violation of this section for a party to enter into, or be a participant to, an agreement, resolving or settling, on a final or interim basis, a patent claim in connection with the sale of a drug product or biological product, that has anticompetitive effects. (2)TreatmentA violation of this section shall be treated as an unfair method of competition in violation of section 5(a)(1).(3)Presumption(A)In generalSubject to subparagraph (B), an agreement described in paragraph (1) shall be presumed to have anticompetitive effects for purposes of such paragraph if—(i)an ANDA filer or a biosimilar biological product application filer receives anything of value, including an exclusive license; and(ii)the ANDA filer or biosimilar biological product application filer agrees to limit or forgo research, development, manufacturing, marketing, or sales of the ANDA product or biosimilar biological product, as applicable, for any period of time.(B)ExceptionSubparagraph (A) shall not apply if the parties to such agreement demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that—(i)the value described in subparagraph (A)(i) is compensation solely for other goods or services that the ANDA filer or biosimilar biological product application filer has promised to provide; or(ii)the procompetitive benefits of the transfer of value described in subparagraph (A)(i) and the agreement by the ANDA filer or biosimilar biological product application filer to limit or forgo research, development, manufacturing, marketing, or sales of the ANDA product or biosimilar biological product described in subparagraph (A)(ii) outweigh the anticompetitive effects of the transfer of value described in subparagraph (A)(i) and the agreement by the ANDA filer or biosimilar biological product application filer to limit or forgo research, development, manufacturing, marketing, or sales of the ANDA product or biosimilar biological product described in subparagraph (A)(ii).(4)Civil actionIn addition to any proceeding under section 5, if the Commission has reason to believe that a party has violated this section, the Commission may bring, in its own name by any of its attorneys designated by it for such purpose, a civil action against the party in a district court of the United States to seek to recover any of the remedies of civil penalty, mandatory injunctions, and such other and further equitable relief as the court deems appropriate.(5)Civil penalty(A)In generalEach party that violates or assists in the violation of paragraph (1) shall forfeit and pay to the United States a civil penalty sufficient to deter violations of paragraph (1), but in no event greater than 3 times the value received by the party that is reasonably attributable to the violation of paragraph (1). If no such value has been received by the NDA holder, the biological product license holder, the ANDA filer, or the biosimilar biological product application filer, the penalty to the NDA holder, the biological product license holder, the ANDA filer, or the biosimilar biological product application filer shall be sufficient to deter violations, but in no event shall be greater than 3 times the value given to an ANDA filer or biosimilar biological product application filer reasonably attributable to the violation of this section. (B)AmountIn determining the amount of the civil penalty described in subparagraph (A), the court shall take into account—(i)the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation;(ii)with respect to the violator, the degree of culpability, any history of prior such conduct, including other agreements resolving or settling a patent infringement claim, the ability to pay, any effect on the ability to continue doing business, profits earned by the NDA holder, the biological product license holder, the ANDA filer, or the biosimilar biological product application filer, compensation received by the ANDA filer or biosimilar biological product application filer, and the amount of commerce affected; and(iii)other matters that justice requires.(C)Remedies in additionRemedies provided in this paragraph are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedy provided by Federal law. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit any authority of the Commission under any other provision of law.(b)ExclusionsNothing in this section shall prohibit a resolution or settlement of a patent infringement claim in which the consideration that the ANDA filer or biosimilar biological product application filer, respectively, receives as part of the resolution or settlement includes only one or more of the following:(1)The right to market and secure final approval in the United States for the ANDA product or biosimilar biological product at a date, whether certain or contingent, prior to the expiration of—(A)any patent that is the basis for the patent infringement claim; or(B)any patent right or other statutory exclusivity that would prevent the marketing of such ANDA product or biosimilar biological product.(2)A payment for reasonable litigation expenses not to exceed—(A)for calendar year 2025, $7,500,000; or(B)for calendar year 2026 and each subsequent calendar year, the amount determined for the preceding calendar year adjusted to reflect the percentage increase (if any) in the Producer Price Index for Legal Services published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor for the most recent calendar year.(3)A covenant not to sue on any claim that the ANDA product or biosimilar biological product infringes a United States patent.(c)Antitrust lawsExcept to the extent this section establishes an additional basis of liability, nothing in this section shall modify, impair, limit, or supersede the applicability of the antitrust laws as defined in subsection (a) of the first section of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12(a)), and of section 5 of this Act to the extent that section 5 applies to unfair methods of competition. Nothing in this section shall modify, impair, limit, or supersede the right of an ANDA filer or biosimilar biological product application filer to assert claims or counterclaims against any person, under the antitrust laws or other laws relating to unfair competition.
