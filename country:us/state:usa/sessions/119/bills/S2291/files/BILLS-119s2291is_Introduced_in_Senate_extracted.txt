Section 3:
3.DefinitionsIn this Act:(1)AdministratorThe term Administrator means the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.(2)Flexible fuel vehicleThe term flexible fuel vehicle has the meaning given the term in section 86.1803–01 of title 40, Code of Federal Regulations (as in effect on the date of enactment of this Act). (3)ManufacturerThe term manufacturer has the meaning given the term in section 216 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7550).

(b)Further adjustmentThe Administrator may, by regulation, apply a larger percentage reduction in the gram per mile CO2 value for flexible fuel vehicles than the percentage described in subsection (a) if the Administrator determines that the larger percentage reduction is appropriate based on a version of the Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Technologies (GREET) model developed by Argonne National Laboratory after the date of enactment of this Act.
