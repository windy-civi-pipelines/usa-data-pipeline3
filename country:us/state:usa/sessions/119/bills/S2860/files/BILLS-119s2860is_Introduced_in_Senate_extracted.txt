            Findings
 Congress finds that—  (1) the United States has a core national security and economic interest in maintaining leadership in deep sea science and technology and seabed mineral resources;
            
            
                (2)
 the United States faces unprecedented economic and national security challenges in securing reliable supplies of critical minerals independent of foreign adversary control;
            
            
                (3)
 vast offshore seabed areas hold critical minerals and energy resources;   (4) offshore seabed resources are key to strengthening the economy of the United States, securing the energy future, and reducing dependence on foreign suppliers for critical minerals;
            
            
                (5)

                (6)
 the United States can, through the exercise of existing authorities and by establishing international partnerships, access potentially vast resources in seabed polymetallic nodules, other subsea geologic structures, and coastal deposits containing strategic minerals such as nickel, cobalt, copper, manganese, titanium, and rare earth elements, which are vital to the national security and economic prosperity of the United States;
            
            
                (7)
 the United States must take immediate action to accelerate the responsible development of seabed mineral resources, quantify the endowment of seabed minerals of the United States, reinvigorate United States leadership in associated extraction and processing technologies, and ensure secure supply chains for the defense, infrastructure, and energy sectors of the United States; and
            
            
                (8)
 it is the policy of the United States to advance United States leadership in seabed mineral development by—
                
                    (A)
 rapidly developing domestic capabilities for the exploration, characterization, collection, and processing of seabed mineral resources through streamlined permitting without compromising environmental and transparency standards;
