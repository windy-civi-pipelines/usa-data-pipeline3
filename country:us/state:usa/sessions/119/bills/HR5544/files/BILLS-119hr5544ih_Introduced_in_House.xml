<paragraph id="H2B99E0203F004B84BB0262CA9468A58F"><enum>(5)</enum><text>The domestic Chinese and international demand for donkey skins is approximately 8,000,000 to 10,000,000 skins per year but the annual supply in China is less than 1,800,000.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H0D8D82104D5940ADBD3A31F0953DEAAA"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Such demand has led to the slaughter of massive numbers of donkeys across the globe, decimating donkey populations, most notably in Africa and Latin America.</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="HA46800919C344D6AB849176163321EAB"><enum>(7)</enum><text>Such demand has had devastating effects on the families who depend on donkeys for survival, such as for farming and construction; transporting water to drink, cook, and clean; taking products to market for sale; and transporting children to school.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H46AE62E717EE4AD896411381E54E16DC"><enum>(8)</enum><text>A report by the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization said that 159,631 donkeys were slaughtered for their skins, 8.1 percent of the population, in 2018. Today, up to 1,000 donkeys a day can be slaughtered in Kenya alone, more than 300,000 a year.</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="H903A3CE1D19D439C8190F1446A25BD55"><enum>(9)</enum><text>Donkeys are regularly stolen and killed illegally solely for their skins. Moreover, donkeys are often stolen from families who depend on them for their livelihoods, and who are already struggling and living below the regional poverty line.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H26C23899E92B410D95834B3BB6D8CA44"><enum>(10)</enum><text>Where owners willingly sell their donkeys, they find that within months they are worse off financially than they would have been had they kept their donkeys. As prices constantly rise, it becomes impossible for these owners to go back into the market for a new donkey.</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="H453BB5A7B5574F7CB47F77F778113CD9"><enum>(11)</enum><text>Although ejiao products are expensive, as the Chinese middle class has expanded, demand for ejiao products has exploded over the course of the last decade. As a result, the donkey population in China has collapsed by 76 percent since 1992.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H2ED5E5854AA740F7B5C94D166B88BD18"><enum>(12)</enum><text>Ejiao companies have set up donkey breeding schemes in China in an attempt to breed the species on a scale sufficient to meet local demand. But due to the long gestation period of donkeys, and the fact that they often only give birth once a year, breeders have not been able to satisfy demand from within China, which is why ejiao companies have turned to Africa and Latin America to satisfy demand for ejiao.</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="HCD3EDA331BCC49A1BEB87C9D423E0449"><enum>(13)</enum><text>A crisis in donkey populations has been met with varied responses from affected countries.

<paragraph id="H9BD3B79ECE6A4CFF8F3DBCD99679B2B1"><enum>(15)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">In February 2024, the African Union adopted a moratorium on the donkey skin trade, signaling a potential end to the legal slaughter of hundreds of thousands of donkeys within the continent. The moratorium now needs to be implemented at the national level by the members of the African Union. This implies potential growth in the illegal trade and expansion into other markets in Asia and Latin America.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HFE799DD1D741420CAA253F8DAAD8A2D9"><enum>(16)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The leading importers in the world for ejiao are Hong Kong and Japan.
