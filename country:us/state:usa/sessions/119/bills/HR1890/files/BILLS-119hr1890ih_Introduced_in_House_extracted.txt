Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Turkey Diplomatic Realignment Act.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following: 
(1)The Republic of Turkey occupies a unique geopolitical position at the intersection of Europe and the Middle East, influencing security, economic, and diplomatic interests of the United States in both regions. (2)The Department of State currently assigns responsibility for Turkey within the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs, despite Turkey’s extensive engagement in Middle Eastern affairs and security issues. 
(3)A reassignment of Turkey to the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs would better align diplomatic strategy and facilitate regional cooperation. (4)Turkey’s foreign policy trajectory in recent years has distanced it from the European Union and The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), as evidenced by its strategic realignments and domestic political shifts that challenge European democratic norms. 
(5)European institutions have increasingly sidelined Turkey from full integration, delaying accession talks and raising concerns over human rights, democratic governance, and rule of law. (6)Turkey’s growing partnerships with non-western powers, including Russia and China, along with its pursuit of BRICS membership, underscore its shifting priorities away from western alignment. 
(7)The Turkish government’s increasing engagement with Islamist actors, its role in conflicts such as Syria and Libya, and its strained relations with Israel have deepened concerns over its long-term reliability as a western partner. (8)The reassignment serves as a diplomatic signal reflecting Turkey’s diminishing European prospects and encourages national debate within Turkey about its geopolitical future, particularly in light of its perceived marginalization from European strategic decision-making. 
(9)Turkey has provided political and logistical support to Hamas, hosting members of the group and facilitating fundraising activities, further straining its relationships with western allies and contributing to concerns over its regional alignment. (10)The United States remains committed to a strong relationship with Turkey but must recalibrate its diplomatic engagement in recognition of changing realities, ensuring U.S. regional policy remains consistent with evolving security and economic dynamics.
