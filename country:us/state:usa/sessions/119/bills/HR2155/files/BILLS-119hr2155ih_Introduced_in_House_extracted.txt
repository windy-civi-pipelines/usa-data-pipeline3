Section 7:
401.Central bank digital currencySection 13 of the Federal Reserve Act is amended by adding after the 14th undesignated paragraph (12 U.S.C. 347d) the following:

No Federal reserve bank, the Board, the Secretary of the Treasury, any other agency, or any entity directed to act on behalf of the Federal reserve bank, the Board, the Secretary, or other agency, may mint or issue a central bank digital currency directly to an individual (including a central bank digital currency issued to an individual through a custodial intermediary) or a digital currency intermediary, offer related products or services directly to an individual, or maintain an account on behalf of an individual (including an account in a specially designated account at a digital currency intermediary or supervised commercial bank).

Section 8:
501.PurposeThe purpose of this title is to increase accountability for and transparency in the Federal regulatory process. Section 1 of article I of the United States Constitution grants all legislative powers to Congress. Over time, Congress has excessively delegated its constitutional charge while failing to conduct appropriate oversight and retain accountability for the content of the laws it passes. By requiring a vote in Congress, the REINS Act will result in more carefully drafted and detailed legislation, an improved regulatory process, and a legislative branch that is truly accountable to the American people for the laws imposed upon them.

(B)by adding at the end the following:  (s)Access of records (1)In generalNotwithstanding any other provision of this title, the Federal Government may not access the financial records or information of an individual in a manner that is prohibited by the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States with respect to the records or information in question.
(2)Aid in statutory constructionIt is the sense of Congress that, through the enactment of this title, Congress has established a statutory right that ensures that the expectation of privacy that the people of the United States have with respect to financial records is protected.. IIIConsolidated audit trail  301.Requirements and prohibitions regarding the Consolidated Audit Trail (a)DefinitionsIn this section:
(1)CommissionThe term Commission means the Securities and Exchange Commission. (2)Consolidated Audit TrailThe term Consolidated Audit Trail means the consolidated audit trail and central repository created, implemented, and maintained pursuant to section 242.613 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, as in effect on the day before the date of enactment of this Act.
(3)Personally identifiable informationThe term personally identifiable information— (A)means information that can be used to distinguish or trace the identity of an individual, either alone or when combined with other personal or identifying information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual, including the name, address, date or year of birth, Social Security number, telephone number, email, or IP-address of an individual; and
(B)does not include a CAT–Order–ID or CAT–Reporter–ID, as those terms are defined in section 242.613(j) of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations (or any successor regulation).  (4)Self-regulatory organizationThe term self-regulatory organization has the meaning given the term in section 3(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)).
(b)RequirementThe Commission shall— (1)not later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act, and notwithstanding any other provision of law or regulation, terminate the Consolidated Audit Trail; and
(2)not later that 120 days after the date of enactment of this Act, amend any regulation, no action letter, interpretive letter, exemptive letter, legal bulletin, or other guidance of the Commission to conform to the requirements of this section. (c)ProhibitionsOn and after the date that the Commission carries out the termination required under subsection (b)(1)— 
(1)neither the Commission nor any self-regulatory organization may administer the Consolidated Audit Trail; and (2)no Federal agency may establish any consolidated audit trail, central repository, or other centralized database that collects personally identifiable information of citizens of the United States, unless a duly enacted law of the United States specifically provides the Federal agency with the authority to take that action.

No Federal reserve bank may hold digital currencies minted or issued by the United States Government as assets or liabilities on a balance sheet of the bank or use such digital currencies as part of fulfilling the requirements under section 2A.. VRegulations from the executive in need of scrutiny 501.PurposeThe purpose of this title is to increase accountability for and transparency in the Federal regulatory process. Section 1 of article I of the United States Constitution grants all legislative powers to Congress. Over time, Congress has excessively delegated its constitutional charge while failing to conduct appropriate oversight and retain accountability for the content of the laws it passes. By requiring a vote in Congress, the REINS Act will result in more carefully drafted and detailed legislation, an improved regulatory process, and a legislative branch that is truly accountable to the American people for the laws imposed upon them.
