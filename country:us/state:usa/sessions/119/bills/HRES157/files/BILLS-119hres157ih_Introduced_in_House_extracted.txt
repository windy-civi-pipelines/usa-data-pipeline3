Section 1:
That John Deacon Bates, a judge of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, is impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors, and that the following article of impeachment be exhibited to the Senate:Article of impeachment exhibited by the House of Representatives of the United States of America in the name of itself and of the people of the United States of America, against John Deacon Bates, a judge of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, in maintenance and support of its impeachment against him for high crimes and misdemeanors.

Section 2:
Article IJohn Deacon Bates, a judge of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, engaged in a pattern of conduct that is incompatible with the trust and confidence placed in him as a Federal judge, as follows:Judge Bates ordered the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to restore socially divisive and destructive LGBTQI+ content on taxpayer subsidized government webpages, in contravention of Executive Order 14168 (January 20, 2025):Judge Bates, in granting a temporary restraining order to the far-left organization, Doctors for America, argued that by removing long relied upon medical resources without explanation, it is likely that the [sic] each agency failed to examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action. He further argued that the agencies did not consider the substantial reliance by medical professionals on the removed webpages. Judge Bates failed to consider that these webpages maintained informational resources on gender affirming care—better described as the intentional surgical or chemical castration of children—and that at no time in the history of the American judicial system, until very recently, would judges have considered the purposeful damage to the bodies of healthy young men and women to be a compelling or even legitimate health concern. To the contrary, it is the opinion of this Congress that the continued socialization of this grave moral evil necessitates immediate action against those who would promote it. Accordingly, Judge John Deacon Bates, has engaged in conduct so utterly lacking in intellectual honesty and basic integrity that he is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors, is unfit to hold the office of Federal judge, and should be removed from office.
