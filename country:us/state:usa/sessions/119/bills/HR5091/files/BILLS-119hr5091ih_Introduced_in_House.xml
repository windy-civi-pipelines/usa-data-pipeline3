Firefighters who engage in such suppression of prescribed fires take on risks, smoke exposure, and arduous tasks comparable to those in wildfire suppression. They should receive hazard pay to fairly compensate their risk and efforts. Likewise, smokejumpers are aerial delivery firefighters whose role in firefighting necessitates jumping from airplanes, which is a hazardous duty that should receive hazard pay.</text></section> <section id="H7D4DC589736446C99E0CA530061BACF7"><enum>2.</enum><header>Hazard pay for performing prescribed burns</header> <subsection id="HAB4579CA334F41CE882A2FE11046195D"><enum>(a)</enum><header>In general</header><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Section 5545 of title 5, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:</text>
