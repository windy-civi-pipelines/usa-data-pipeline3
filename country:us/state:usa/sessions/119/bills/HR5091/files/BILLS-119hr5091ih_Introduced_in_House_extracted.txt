Section 1:
1.Sense of CongressIt is the sense of Congress that the control and suppression of prescribed fires is an important part of fire preparedness and land management. Firefighters who engage in such suppression of prescribed fires take on risks, smoke exposure, and arduous tasks comparable to those in wildfire suppression. They should receive hazard pay to fairly compensate their risk and efforts. Likewise, smokejumpers are aerial delivery firefighters whose role in firefighting necessitates jumping from airplanes, which is a hazardous duty that should receive hazard pay.

(2)In this subsection, the term prescribed burn means the intentional application of fire to live or dead vegetation or forestry, range, or other landscapes for the purposes of land or resource management..
