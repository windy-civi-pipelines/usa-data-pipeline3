Section 1:
1.Short title
 This Act may be cited as the Leveraging Efficiency Awareness for Pumping Systems Act or the LEAPS Act.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following: (1)There are over 600,000 pumping systems used for irrigation on agricultural land in the United States, many of which still rely on fossil fuels. 
(2)Improving the efficiency of agricultural irrigation pumping systems can save up to 22 billion kilowatt hours of energy per year and eliminate 8.3 million metric tons of carbon emissions annually. (3)Energy savings from electrifying agricultural irrigation pumping systems can save farmers and ranchers more than $1.8 billion annually in energy costs. 
(4)Pumping systems play a central role in the watering of livestock and the management of animal waste in every State. (5)Pumping systems are a critical component of the Nation’s $2,300,000,000 aquaculture industry. 
(6)Improving the efficiency of pumping systems used in raising livestock and fish can significantly reduce energy use, save producers millions of dollars annually, and provide meaningful reductions in carbon emissions. (7)Agricultural irrigation pumping systems utilizing plastic piping can provide significant drought relief benefits, dramatically reducing water losses from evaporation and seepage; agriculture uses 37 percent of the Nation’s surface and ground water, 30 percent of which is lost to seepage and evaporation. 
(8)Reducing the friction in piping used for agricultural irrigation and livestock watering can provide meaningful energy and cost savings; there are potentially 2,500 kWh of energy savings for every 10 miles of plastic piping utilized in delivering water for crops and livestock. (9)Solar pumping systems can play an important role in protecting riparian habitat and improving water quality in streams, rivers, lakes, and estuaries through providing alternative watering options for livestock.

Section 3:
3.Information on energy-efficient pumping systems 
(a)In generalNot later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary, in consultation with pumping system experts, in order to educate farmers on the benefits of energy-efficient pumping systems, shall develop and make publicly available on the website of the Department of Agriculture easily accessible information on cost savings, energy savings, water conservation, and carbon emissions reductions that can be realized through the use of energy-efficient pumping systems. (b)ContentsIn carrying out subsection (a), the Secretary shall include information on— 
(1)pumps, pipes, motors, drives, and controls that can provide energy savings and cost savings, conserve water, and reduce carbon emissions; and (2)Department of Agriculture programs that provide farmers resources for acquiring energy-efficient pumping systems and drought management infrastructure, including the environmental quality incentives program, the Rural Energy for America Program, and the conservation stewardship program.

Section 4:
4.Energy efficiency pre-assessment tool 
(a)In generalNot later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary, in consultation with pumping system experts, in order to raise awareness of the benefits of energy-efficient pumping systems and increase participation in Department of Agriculture programs that promote energy efficiency, shall develop and make publicly available on the website of the Department of Agriculture a user-friendly tool to— (1)assist farmers in making a preliminary assessment of the energy efficiency of existing pumping systems; and 
(2)provide an estimate of potential energy savings, cost savings, and carbon emissions reductions that may be realized through pumping system improvements. (b)Requirements (1)Ease of useThe Secretary shall ensure that the tool made available under subsection (a) provides a user with projected energy savings, projected cost savings, and projected carbon emissions reductions through the input by the user of the following data relating to an existing pumping system: 
(A)Pump type. (B)Flow rating and actual flow. 
(C)Pressure rating and actual pressure. (D)Speed rating and actual speed. 
(2)ConsiderationsThe Secretary shall ensure that the tool made available under subsection (a)— (A)in assessing the energy efficiency of a pumping system, takes into consideration pumps, pipes, motors, drives, and controls associated with the pumping system; and 
(B)in projecting the energy savings, cost savings, and carbon emissions reductions that may be realized through pumping system improvements, takes into consideration the cost of electricity and the profile of the existing pumping system.

Section 5:
5.Energy auditor education (a)In generalNot later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary, in consultation with pumping system experts, in order to increase the effectiveness of Department of Agriculture energy efficiency programs, shall establish a process to educate persons performing energy efficiency audits for the Department of Agriculture on energy use and energy efficiency in pumping systems. 
(b)ImplementationIn carrying out subsection (a), the Secretary shall consider the use of existing education and training programs focused on energy use and energy efficiency in pumping systems.

Section 6:
6.Conservation stewardship program activitiesSection 1240I(2)(B)(i) of the Food Security Act of 1985 (16 U.S.C. 3839aa–21(2)(B)(i)) is amended by inserting and energy-efficient pumping systems before , as determined.

Section 7:
7.DefinitionsIn this Act: (1)SecretaryThe term Secretary means the Secretary of Agriculture. 
(2)Pumping systemThe term pumping system means any pumps, pipes, motors, drives, and controls used to move water and other fluids on farms, ranches, and aquaculture operations.
