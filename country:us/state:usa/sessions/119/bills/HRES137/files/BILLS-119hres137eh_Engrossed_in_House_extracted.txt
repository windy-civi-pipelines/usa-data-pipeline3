RESOLUTION 
Resolution designating the House Press Gallery (Rooms H–315, H–316, H–317, H–318, and H–319 of the United States Capitol) as the Frederick Douglass Press Gallery. 
 
 
Whereas Frederick Douglass was born to an enslaved family in 1818; Whereas Douglass bravely escaped slavery in 1838, and spent much of his adult life as a journalist in Rochester, New York; 
Whereas Douglass published his first newspaper, The North Star, using his own money in the pre-Civil War era; Whereas Douglass was known for fiercely opposing slavery, championing equal rights and women’s rights, and for being a forceful speaker; 
Whereas, during the Civil War, Douglass was a recruiter for the first African-American Army regiment; Whereas Douglass met twice with President Lincoln, first about the pay and treatment of Black soldiers and then to discuss the President’s desire to assist escaping slaves; 
Whereas after Douglass’ Rochester home was destroyed by fire (which Douglass believed resulted from arson), he moved his family to Anacostia in Washington, DC; Whereas, in 1870, Douglass was asked to become editor of the New National Era, which chronicled the progress of Blacks throughout the United States, and he later bought the paper; 
Whereas Douglass was the first Black reporter allowed into the Capitol press galleries, where journalists watch lawmakers on the floors of the Senate and the House of Representatives; Whereas Douglass was a member of the congressional press galleries from 1871–1875; 
Whereas Douglass reported on House and Senate legislation regularly to update the African-American community during Reconstruction following the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the Constitution; Whereas Douglass was recorded frequently in the congressional directory and spent a significant amount of time writing and studying from the House Press Gallery; 
Whereas Douglass often visited the Capitol following his time as a member of the congressional press galleries; Whereas Douglass delivered the keynote speech at the unveiling of the Emancipation Memorial in Washington’s Lincoln Park; 
Whereas, in 2007, Douglass was recognized by placing a plaque and painting of him in his honor in the House Press Gallery; Whereas, in 2012, Congress passed and the President signed Public Law 112–174, which directed Frederick Douglass’ statue placement in the Capitol Visitor Center’s Emancipation Hall; and 
Whereas Douglass was a pioneer in journalism who broke through glass ceilings throughout one of the most crucial times in American history, exhibited great perseverance to become an American hero, and became a legend known in the House Press Gallery: Now, therefore, be it  That the House Press Gallery (Rooms H–315, H–316, H–317, H–318, and H–319 of the United States Capitol) is designated as the Frederick Douglass Press Gallery.
