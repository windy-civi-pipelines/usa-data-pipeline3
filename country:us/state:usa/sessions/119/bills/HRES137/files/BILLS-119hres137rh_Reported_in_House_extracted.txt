Whereas, during the Civil War, Douglass was a recruiter for the first African-American army regiment; Whereas Douglass met twice with President Lincoln, first about the pay and treatment of Black soldiers and then to discuss the President’s desire to assist escaping slaves; 
Whereas after Douglass’ Rochester home was destroyed by fire (which Douglass believed resulted from arson), he moved his family to Anacostia in Washington, DC; Whereas, in 1870, Douglass was asked to become editor of the New National Era, which chronicled the progress of Blacks throughout the United States, and he later bought the paper; 
Whereas Douglass was the first Black reporter allowed into the Capitol press galleries, where journalists watch lawmakers on the floors of the Senate and the House of Representatives; Whereas Douglass was a member of the congressional press galleries from 1871–1875; 
Whereas Douglass reported on House and Senate legislation regularly to update the African-American community during Reconstruction following the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the Constitution; Whereas Douglass was recorded frequently in the congressional directory and spent a significant amount of time writing and studying from the House Press Gallery; 
Whereas Douglass often visited the Capitol following his time as a member of the congressional press galleries; Whereas Douglass delivered the keynote speech at the unveiling of the Emancipation Memorial in Washington’s Lincoln Park; 
Whereas, in 2007, Douglass was recognized by placing a plaque and painting of him in his honor in the House Press Gallery; Whereas, in 2012, Congress passed and the President signed Public Law 112–174, which directed Frederick Douglass’ statue placement in the Capitol Visitor Center’s Emancipation Hall; and
