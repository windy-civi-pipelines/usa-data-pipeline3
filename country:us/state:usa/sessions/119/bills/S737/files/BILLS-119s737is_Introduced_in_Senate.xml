In Ashcroft v. ACLU, 542 U.S. 656 (2004), the Court even suggested at the time that <quote>blocking and filtering software</quote> could conceivably be a <quote>primary alternative</quote> to the requirements passed by Congress.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="id4cec2b34ff7f4ed6a406695debc8466d"><enum>(3)</enum><text>In the nearly 2 decades since the Supreme Court of the United States suggested the use of <quote>blocking and filtering software</quote>, such technology has proven to be ineffective in protecting minors from accessing online pornographic content. The Kaiser Family Foundation has found that filters do not work on 1 in 10 pornography sites accessed intentionally and 1 in 3 pornography sites that are accessed unintentionally. Further, it has been proven that children are able to bypass <quote>blocking and filtering</quote> software by employing strategic searches or measures to bypass the software completely.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="id5a771360dca746c89ce6be3fbc0e0a73"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Additionally, Pew Research has revealed studies showing that only 39 percent of parents use blocking or filtering software for their minor’s online activities, meaning that 61 percent of children only have restrictions on their internet access when they are at school or at a library.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="idbc89c483fd2944d795b2c837a3088ecd"><enum>(5)</enum><text>17 States have now recognized pornography as a public health hazard that leads to a broad range of individual harms, societal harms, and public health impacts.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="ided95fd046571415fac237a813c69fa55"><enum>(6)</enum><text>It is estimated that 80 percent of minors between the ages of 12 to 17 have been exposed to pornography, with 54 percent of teenagers seeking it out.

combined.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="id8bcf923ecdd34456ac17cdd023017c9d"><enum>(7)</enum><text>Exposure to online pornography has created unique psychological effects for minors, including
