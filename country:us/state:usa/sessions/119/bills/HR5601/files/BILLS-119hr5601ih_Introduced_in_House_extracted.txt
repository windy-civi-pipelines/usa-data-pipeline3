Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Faith in Housing Act of 2025.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following: 
(1)An underproduction in housing units relative to demand has led to a housing shortage of millions of homes in the United States. (2)Lack of housing supply and rising rent costs exacerbate inequality and reduce opportunity for many people in the United States. 
(3)People in the United States who are unable to afford rising housing costs can fall into homelessness, causing both personal tragedy and challenges to public and charitable social services. (4)Houses of worship from every major faith tradition are involved in charitable activities to support low-income people in the United States facing housing insecurity. 
(5)The efforts of houses of worship to shelter homeless people in the United States, provide affordable or supportive housing, and serve the poor are obstructed by land use regulation that prohibits or curtails the ability of the house of worship to meet this mission. (6)The ability of houses of worship to serve their mission would be enhanced by allowing them the discretion to provide for the construction of affordable homes and homeless shelters. 
(7)The construction of housing is a form of interstate commerce that affects the economy and social welfare of the United States. State and local land use regulation has national and interstate effects on the housing shortage, level of housing insecurity and homelessness, and need for social services.
