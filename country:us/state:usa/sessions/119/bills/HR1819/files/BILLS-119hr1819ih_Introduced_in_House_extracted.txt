Section 1:
1.FindingsCongress finds the following:(1)On November 18, 1952, then Lieutenant E. Royce Williams and Combat Air Patrol Task Force 77 carried out an airstrike on the Hoeryong industrial complex near the Korea-Russia border. In response, seven Soviet MiG–15s launched from a Soviet base near Vladivostok. Williams and three other U.S. pilots flying F9F–5 Panthers were dispatched from the U.S.S. Oriskany to pursue the seven MiG–15s in blizzard conditions to engage over the Sea of Japan.(2)When the Flight Leader’s instruments reported a fuel-pump warning, he was escorted back to the U.S.S. Oriskany by his wingman.(3)Williams and his wingman, Dave Rowlands, remained airborne. Williams fired upon one MiG–15 and Rowlands followed it out of formation, leaving Williams to pursue the remaining six MiG–15s on his own. In his efforts, Williams expended all of his ammunition and shot down four, very likely five, of the seven Soviet MiG–15s, setting the American aviator record for MiGs shot in a single sortie and the only naval dogfight over water in the Korean War.(4)After sustaining a hit from a 37 millimeter shell that disabled his electrical and hydraulic systems, Williams underwent enemy fire while returning to the carrier as well as friendly fire from escort vessels after being mistaken for enemy aircraft.(5)Without rudders to slow his descent, Williams landed on the U.S.S. Oriskany at a speed of 170 knots, miraculously able to safely engage the number three wire.(6)Williams’ aircraft sustained 263 holes and a foot-long gash while the only injury sustained by Williams was a bloody neck, chafed by his gear. Williams was told not to speak of the events of that day by his commanders, and, at the time, was only officially credited for one downed and one damaged enemy in the fight.(7)Witnesses to this heroism were the first unit of the then newly created National Security Agency, codenamed Canoe, aboard the USS Helena. Intercepting Soviet communications, the unit recorded the transmissions that three Soviet MiGs were shot down, and one pilot ejected his compromised aircraft and then died. One aircraft returned to base in Vladivostok.(8)At the end of the Cold War, Russia released the names of the four pilots shot down in combat on November 18, 1952.(9)When Williams was awarded the Silver Star for his actions on November 18, 1952, the drafters did not have access to the top secret radio intelligence or the subsequent Russian report released after the Cold War.(10)Williams served in the Navy for over 30 years, flew over 220 missions in Korea and Vietnam, and retired in 1984.(11)On January 20th, 2023, Williams’ Silver Star was upgraded by the Secretary of the Navy to the Navy Cross.(12)E. Royce Williams deserves the Congressional Medal of Honor for his heroic actions on November 18, 1952, when he successfully eliminated four, likely five, of seven MiG–15s in a far less superior aircraft during the 35-minute-long aerial battle wherein he never once sought safety in the clouds or abandoned the mission despite being outnumbered and outgunned.
