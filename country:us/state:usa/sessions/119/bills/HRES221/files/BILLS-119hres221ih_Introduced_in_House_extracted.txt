IV119th CONGRESS1st SessionH. RES. 221IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESMarch 14, 2025Mr. Foster (for himself, Ms. Bonamici, Mr. Carson, Mr. Casten, Mr. Cohen, Mr. Fleischmann, Ms. Kaptur, Ms. McCollum, Mr. Mullin, Ms. Rivas, and Ms. Stevens) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Science, Space, and TechnologyRESOLUTIONExpressing support for designation of March 14, 2025, as National Pi Day. 
Whereas the Greek letter (Pi) is the symbol for the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter;  Whereas Pi is an irrational number, which will continue infinitely without repeating, and has been calculated to over 202 trillion digits;  
Whereas Pi is a fundamental mathematical constant that has been studied throughout history and is central in mathematics as well as science and engineering;  Whereas mathematics and science are a critical part of children’s education;  
Whereas aptitude in mathematics, science, and engineering is essential for a knowledge-based society;  Whereas, according to the 2023 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) survey done by the National Center for Education Statistics, American children in the fourth and eighth grades were outperformed by students in other countries including Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan;  
Whereas Black and Hispanic students and students from schools with high poverty rates have lower than average scores on the TIMSS survey;  Whereas boys in fourth and eighth grades had higher scores than girls in math and science on the TIMSS survey, indicating a gender gap beginning early in their education;  
Whereas the United States needs to reinforce mathematics and science education for all students in order to better prepare children for the future and to succeed in a 21st-century economy;  Whereas the National Science Foundation has been driving innovation in math and science education at all levels from elementary through graduate education since its creation 75 years ago;  
Whereas mathematics and science can be a fun and interesting part of a child’s education, and learning about Pi can be an engaging way to teach children about geometry and attract them to study science and mathematics; and  Whereas Pi can be approximated as 3.14, and thus March 14, 2025, is an appropriate day for National Pi Day: Now, therefore, be it 
That the House of Representatives— (1)supports the designation of a Pi Day and its celebration around the world; 
(2)recognizes the continuing importance of the National Science Foundation’s math and science education programs; and (3)encourages schools and educators to observe the day with appropriate activities that teach students about Pi and engage them about the study of mathematics.
