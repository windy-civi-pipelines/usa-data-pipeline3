<whereas><text>Whereas Black and Hispanic students and students from schools with high poverty rates have lower than average scores on the TIMSS survey;</text> </whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas boys in fourth and eighth grades had higher scores than girls in math and science on the TIMSS survey, indicating a gender gap beginning early in their education;</text> </whereas> 
<whereas><text>Whereas the United States needs to reinforce mathematics and science education for all students in order to better prepare children for the future and to succeed in a 21st-century economy;</text> </whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas the National Science Foundation has been driving innovation in math and science education at all levels from elementary through graduate education since its creation 75 years ago;</text> </whereas>
