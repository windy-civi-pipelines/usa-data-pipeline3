Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Genome to Phenome Initiative Reauthorization Act of 2025 or the AG2PI Act of 2025.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following: 
(1)Understanding crop and livestock genomes (genes) and phenomes (traits) has been a significant roadblock in converting what we know about genetics into useful improvements in agriculturally important species.  (2)Significant research is needed to fully characterize phenomes and how these plant and livestock traits relate to genes, disease resilience, and environmental factors.  
(3)This information will help farmers and ranchers determine the best combinations of genetics and management practices to improve the resilience, productivity, and profitability of their businesses. (4)Reauthorization of the Genome to Phenome Initiative to build on the work of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (Public Law 115–334) is critical.  
(5)In addition, reauthorization will help support a broad network of researchers, including data scientists, engineers, agricultural economists, and social scientists, and will help develop the most promising of the new concepts generated via the seed grant program into full-fledged research projects.  (6)These efforts will ultimately promote efficient and sustainable agricultural production systems under current as well as future climactic conditions.

Section 3:
