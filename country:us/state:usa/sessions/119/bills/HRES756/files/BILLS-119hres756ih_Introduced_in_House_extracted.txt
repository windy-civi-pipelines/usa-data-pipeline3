IV119th CONGRESS1st SessionH. RES. 756IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESSeptember 19, 2025Mr. Veasey (for himself, Mr. Scott of Virginia, Ms. Sewell, Ms. Williams of Georgia, Mr. Green of Texas, Ms. Meng, Mr. Johnson of Georgia, Mr. Fields, Mr. Deluzio, Ms. Barragán, Ms. Johnson of Texas, Mr. Mullin, Ms. Davids of Kansas, Ms. Kamlager-Dove, Mrs. Watson Coleman, Ms. McClellan, Mr. Cleaver, Mr. Carter of Louisiana, Ms. Plaskett, Ms. McCollum, Mr. Olszewski, Ms. Ansari, and Ms. Crockett) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary, and in addition to the Committees on House Administration, Science, Space, and Technology, Oversight and Government Reform, Financial Services, Ways and Means, Natural Resources, and Homeland Security, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concernedRESOLUTIONSupporting the designation of September 2025 as National Voting Rights Month. 
Whereas voting is one of the single most important rights that can be exercised in a democracy;  Whereas, over the course of history, various voter suppression laws in the United States have hindered, and even prohibited, certain individuals and groups from exercising the right to vote;
     

 Whereas, during the 19th and early 20th centuries, Native Americans, people who were born to United States citizens abroad, people who spoke a language other than English, and people who were formerly subjected to slavery were denied full citizenship and prevented from voting by English literacy tests;
     

 Whereas, since the 1870s, minority groups, such as Black Americans in the South, have suffered from the oppressive effects of Jim Crow laws that were designed to prevent political, economic, and social mobility;
     

 Whereas Black Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, Native Americans, and other underrepresented voters were subject to violence, poll taxes, literacy tests, all-White primaries, property ownership tests, and grandfather clauses designed to suppress the right of those underrepresented individuals to vote;
     

 Whereas, as of 2024, 4,404,000 people in the United States were disenfranchised from voting because of a felony conviction, including 1 in 16 Black adults, due to the shameful entanglement of racial injustice in the criminal justice system and access to voting in the United States;
     
Whereas members of the aforementioned groups and others are currently subject to intimidation, voter roll purges, and financial barriers that effectively act as modern-day poll taxes;  Whereas, in 1965, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 10301 et seq.) in large part to protect the right of Black Americans and other traditionally disenfranchised groups to vote;
     

 Whereas, in 2013, in the landmark case of Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 529 (2013), the Supreme Court invalidated section 4 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 10303), dismantling the preclearance formula provision that protected voters in States and localities that have historically suppressed the right of minorities to vote by requiring those states to receive preapproval from the Federal Government for changes in voting laws;
     

 Whereas, since the invalidation of the preclearance formula provision of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 10301 et seq.), gerrymandered districts in many States go unchallenged and are less likely to be invalidated by the courts;
     
Whereas gerrymandered districts in many States have been found to have a discriminatory impact on traditionally disenfranchised minorities through tactics that include cracking, diluting the voting power of minorities across many districts, and packing, concentrating the power of minority voters into one district to reduce their voting power in other districts; Whereas the courts have found the congressional and, in some cases, State legislative district maps in Texas, North Carolina, Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, Alabama, and Louisiana to be gerrymandered districts created to favor some groups over others, and State legislatures with Republican majorities are actively working to further gerrymander districts before the next Federal election; 
Whereas some States have implemented new voting restrictions that make it more difficult to vote, including cutbacks in the availability of early voting, voter roll purges, placement of faulty equipment in minority communities, requirement of photo identification, and the elimination of same-day registration; Whereas those policies could outright disenfranchise or make voting much more difficult for more than 80,000,000 minority, elderly, poor, and disabled voters, among other groups; 

 Whereas, in 2016, discriminatory laws in North Carolina, Wisconsin, North Dakota, and Texas were ruled to violate the rights of voters and were overturned by the courts;
     
Whereas the decision of the Supreme Court in Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 529 (2013), calls on Congress to update the formula in the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 10301 et seq.); Whereas addressing the challenges of administering future elections requires increasing the accessibility of vote-by-mail and other limited-contact options to ensure access to the ballot and the protection of the health and safety of voters, and access to the ballot amid a global pandemic like the public health emergency caused by the Coronavirus Disease 2019; 
Whereas Congress must work to combat any attempts to dismantle or underfund the United States Postal Service or obstruct the passage of the mail as blatant tactics of voter suppression and election interference;  Whereas, following the 2020 elections, there has been a relentless attack on the right to vote with more than 400 bills introduced and at least 44 bills signed into law in 18 States to restrict the right to vote;
     
Whereas there is much more work to be done to ensure all citizens of the United States have the right to vote through free, fair, and accessible elections, and Congress must exercise its constitutional authority to protect the right to vote; Whereas National Voter Registration Day in 2025 is Tuesday, September 16; and 
Whereas September 2025 would be an appropriate month— (1)to designate as National Voting Rights Month; and 
(2)to ensure that, through the registration of voters and awareness of elections, the democracy of the United States includes all citizens of the United States: Now, therefore, be it That the House of Representatives— 
(1)expresses support for a National Voting Rights Month; (2)encourages all people in the United States to uphold the right of every citizen to exercise the sacred and fundamental right to vote; 
(3)encourages Congress to pass— (A)the Freedom to Vote Act (H.R. 11, S. 1, 118th Congress), to set national standards to expand voter registration and voting access, advance election integrity reforms, and protect the democracy of the United States; 
(B)the Democracy Restoration Act of 2023 (H.R. 4987, S. 1677, 118th Congress), to restore Federal voting rights to citizens after release from imprisonment, honoring the responsibilities of citizenship and civic engagement necessary for building healthy and safe communities while welcoming the civic contributions of people returning home after imprisonment; and (C)other voting rights legislation that seeks to advance voting rights and protect elections in the United States; 
(4)recommends that public schools and universities in the United States develop an academic curriculum that educates students about— (A)the importance of voting, how to register to vote, where to vote, and the different forms of voting; 
(B)the history of voter suppression in the United States before and after passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 10301 et seq.); and (C)current measures that are restricting the right to vote; 
(5)expresses appreciation for the United States Postal Service for issuing a special Representative John R. Lewis stamp— (A)to honor the life and legacy of Representative John R. Lewis in supporting voting rights; and 
(B)to remind people in the United States that ordinary citizens risked their lives, marched, and participated in the great democracy of the United States so that all citizens would have the fundamental right to vote; and (6)invites Congress to allocate the requisite funds for public service announcements on television, radio, newspapers, magazines, social media, billboards, buses, and other forms of media— 
(A)to remind people in the United States when elections are being held; (B)to share important registration deadlines; and 
(C)to urge people to get out and vote.
