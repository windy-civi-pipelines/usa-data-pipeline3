<whereas><text>Whereas Dr. Paul Farmer, who pioneered novel community-based strategies for the delivery of high-quality health care in impoverished settings, inspired a paradigmatic shift in global health, including inspiring robust United States leadership to address the global HIV/AIDS epidemic in the early 2000s via the United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria;</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas, in spite of this progress, weak health systems continue to cause millions of people, primarily the global poor, to die tragic and unnecessary deaths, including—</text>

<whereas><text>Whereas relative to the size of the United States economy, the United States official overseas development spending is low at 0.17 percent of gross national income (GNI) in 2020, placing the United States 24th out of the 29 country members of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Development Assistance Committee, and meeting just one-fourth of the United Nations official development assistance target of 0.7 percent GNI;</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas dramatically increasing foreign aid may have voter support, given that opinion polls consistently find that Americans believe United States foreign aid should make up approximately 10 percent of the Federal budget;</text></whereas>

<whereas><text>Whereas the inability of many of the poorest developing countries to fully close the financing gap for universal health coverage and the provision of numerous other public goods and services is in part due to the intimate economic links between these countries and high-income countries, including the United States, which have been marked throughout history by acts of violence and coercion, including, but not limited to—</text> <paragraph id="HE2098C7A34144D28A42822AB8D0A1582"><enum>(1)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">the fundamental injustice, cruelty, brutality, and inhumanity of colonization and slavery;</text></paragraph>

<whereas><text>Whereas the United States leadership to close the financing gaps for essential universal health coverage in low- and lower-middle-income countries could precipitate increased global health financing from other donor partners as evidenced by United States leadership to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the early 2000s, spurring a 100-percent increase in global overseas development assistance among all donor partners from 2000 to 2006;</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas official United States development assistance to low- and lower-middle-income countries are not a supplement for United States action to stop ongoing structural violence and economic injustices preventing countries from financing and delivering universal health care and other social services for their populations; and</text></whereas>
