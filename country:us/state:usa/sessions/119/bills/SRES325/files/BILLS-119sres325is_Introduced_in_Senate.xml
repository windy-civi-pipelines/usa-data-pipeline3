        <whereas>
 <text>Whereas the investigation into the sex-trafficking network operated by Jeffery Epstein (referred to in this preamble as the <quote>Epstein investigation</quote>) raised urgent questions about how a wealthy, well-connected individual was able to commit crimes against minors with impunity for years;</text>
        </whereas>
        <whereas commented="no">
 <text>Whereas, in July 2019, Epstein was arrested on Federal sex-trafficking charges and died by suicide weeks later in Federal custody at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, precluding a public trial and full airing of evidence;</text>
        </whereas>
        <whereas commented="no">
 <text>Whereas, following the death of Epstein, many victims, advocates, and members of the public called for comprehensive transparency and accountability, including access to materials gathered during the Epstein investigation that could be released lawfully;</text>
        </whereas>
        <whereas commented="no">
 <text>Whereas, in February 2025, Attorney General Pam Bondi stated on a television station broadcasted across the United States that a <quote>client list</quote> related to the network operated by Epstein was <quote>sitting on [her] desk</quote>;</text>
        </whereas>
        <whereas commented="no">
 <text>Whereas Bondi, alongside the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Kash Patel and the Deputy Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Dan Bongino, repeatedly pledged to deliver full transparency, suggesting that key documents, including flight logs and black books, were being reviewed and prepared for public release;</text>
        </whereas>
        <whereas commented="no">
 <text>Whereas, in 2023, Patel stated that Epstein's <quote>black book</quote> was <quote>under direct control of the Director of the FBI</quote> and that Trump <quote>should roll out the black book</quote> on day one;</text>
        </whereas>
        <whereas commented="no">
 <text>Whereas, in February 2025, Attorney General Pam Bondi distributed binders labeled <quote>The Epstein Files: Phase 1</quote> to a group of right-wing influencers during a White House visit, claiming they contained declassified materials from the Epstein investigation;</text>
        </whereas>
        <whereas commented="no">
 <text>Whereas, in February 2025, Attorney General Pam Bondi publicly alleged that she was misled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation regarding the scope of the Epstein investigation files, stating in a letter to the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Kash Patel that a whistleblower had informed her that the New York Field Office for the Federal Bureau of Investigation was in possession of thousands of pages of additional documents that had not been disclosed despite repeated requests;</text>
        </whereas>
        <whereas commented="no">
 <text>Whereas these statements were amplified by senior officials and widely disseminated across traditional and social media, creating a legitimate public expectation that the Department of Justice would release meaningful new disclosures;</text>
        </whereas>
        <whereas commented="no">
 <text>Whereas, in July 2025, the Department of Justice issued an unsigned, 2-page memorandum stating there was no <quote>client list</quote>, no evidence of blackmail schemes involving public figures, and that further disclosure of materials was not <quote>appropriate or warranted</quote>;</text>
        </whereas>
        <whereas commented="no">
 <text>Whereas the memo did not provide an explanation of how these determinations were reached, nor did it specify which documents had been reviewed or why materials earlier described as forthcoming were now being withheld;</text>
        </whereas>
        <whereas commented="no">
 <text>Whereas this abrupt reversal, paired with a lack of accountability or clarification from leadership in the Department of Justice, has fueled further speculation, intensified misinformation, and contributed to a public perception that political considerations, not legal standards, are governing disclosure decisions;</text>
        </whereas>
        <whereas commented="no">
 <text>Whereas victims of the abuse carried out by Epstein or related to his trafficking network, along with the broader public, deserve clarity on what happened, how evidence has been handled, and whether any institutional failures contributed to the delayed or incomplete pursuit of justice;</text>
        </whereas>
        <whereas commented="no">
 <text>Whereas public trust in the Department of Justice depends on consistent, fact-based communications and a demonstrated commitment to accountability that transcends political pressure;</text>
        </whereas>
        <whereas commented="no">
 <text>Whereas the disclosure of non-sensitive materials, such as timelines, investigatory summaries, indices of sealed filings, and previously released documents in structured formats, would serve the public interest while protecting the privacy and dignity of victims; and</text>
        </whereas>
        <whereas>
 <text>Whereas the responsible release of information ensures that public institutions are transparent, credible, and accountable to the people they serve: Now, therefore, be it</text>
