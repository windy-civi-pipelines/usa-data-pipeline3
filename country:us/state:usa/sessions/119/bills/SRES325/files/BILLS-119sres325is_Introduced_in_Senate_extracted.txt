Section 1:
That it is the sense of the Senate that—  (1) prior to any other action related to the investigation of Jeffery Epstein (referred to in this resolving clause as the Epstein investigation), the Department of Justice should meet with the identified victims of Jeffery Epstein and their representatives to answer questions about the investigations and prosecutions related to the Epstein investigation and to provide the materials the Department of Justice intends to make public;
            
            
                (2)
 the Department of Justice should publicly clarify the full scope of materials in its possession related to the Epstein investigation, including which materials have been reviewed and which remain under seal;
            
            
                (3)
 the Department of Justice should release all appropriate records related to the Epstein investigation, such as flight manifests, investigatory summaries, chain-of-custody documentation, and any material previously entered into the public record but not widely disseminated;
            
            
                (4)
 any internal memos or legal analyses justifying the withholding of materials related to the Epstein investigation should be released, in redacted form where appropriate, to clarify the basis for the determinations of the Department of Justice and protect the identity of victims;
            
            
                (5)
 the Department of Justice must correct prior misleading or inaccurate statements by senior officials of the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation regarding the existence of certain records, timelines for review, and commitments to transparency, related to the Epstein investigation;
            
            
                (6)
 public officials have a responsibility to communicate accurately and responsibly, particularly in matters involving victims of sex trafficking and public corruption, and failure to do so undermines faith in the justice system;
            
            
                (7)
 the Senate reaffirms its support for full accountability regarding the Epstein investigation, including the identification of any co-conspirators, public or private, whose conduct was criminal, and calls upon the Department of Justice to explain what steps, if any, it has taken to pursue such co-conspirators;
            
            
                (8)
 the Department of Justice should prioritize victim protection in any future disclosures, including by redacting personal information, withholding identifying images, and ensuring that materials cannot be used to re-traumatize victims or incite harassment; and
            
            
                (9)
 the Senate recognizes that truth and transparency are essential to countering misinformation, preventing future abuse, and preserving the integrity of public institutions and the justice system.

        III
        119th CONGRESS
        1st Session
        S. RES. 325
        IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
        
            July 17, 2025
            Mr. Gallego submitted the following
                resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary
        
        RESOLUTION
        Expressing the sense of the Senate that the Department of
            Justice should release appropriate, non-sensitive materials related to the investigation
            of Jeffery Epstein to restore public trust, affirm institutional accountability, and
            prevent the politicization of justice.
    
    
        
 Whereas the investigation into the sex-trafficking network operated by Jeffery Epstein (referred to in this preamble as the Epstein investigation) raised urgent questions about how a wealthy, well-connected individual was able to commit crimes against minors with impunity for years;
        
        
 Whereas, in July 2019, Epstein was arrested on Federal sex-trafficking charges and died by suicide weeks later in Federal custody at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, precluding a public trial and full airing of evidence;
        
        
 Whereas, following the death of Epstein, many victims, advocates, and members of the public called for comprehensive transparency and accountability, including access to materials gathered during the Epstein investigation that could be released lawfully;
        
        
 Whereas, in February 2025, Attorney General Pam Bondi stated on a television station broadcasted across the United States that a client list related to the network operated by Epstein was sitting on [her] desk;
        
        
 Whereas Bondi, alongside the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Kash Patel and the Deputy Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Dan Bongino, repeatedly pledged to deliver full transparency, suggesting that key documents, including flight logs and black books, were being reviewed and prepared for public release;
        
        
 Whereas, in 2023, Patel stated that Epstein's black book was under direct control of the Director of the FBI and that Trump should roll out the black book on day one;
        
        
 Whereas, in February 2025, Attorney General Pam Bondi distributed binders labeled The Epstein Files: Phase 1 to a group of right-wing influencers during a White House visit, claiming they contained declassified materials from the Epstein investigation;
        
        
 Whereas, in February 2025, Attorney General Pam Bondi publicly alleged that she was misled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation regarding the scope of the Epstein investigation files, stating in a letter to the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Kash Patel that a whistleblower had informed her that the New York Field Office for the Federal Bureau of Investigation was in possession of thousands of pages of additional documents that had not been disclosed despite repeated requests;
        
        
 Whereas these statements were amplified by senior officials and widely disseminated across traditional and social media, creating a legitimate public expectation that the Department of Justice would release meaningful new disclosures;
        
        
 Whereas, in July 2025, the Department of Justice issued an unsigned, 2-page memorandum stating there was no client list, no evidence of blackmail schemes involving public figures, and that further disclosure of materials was not appropriate or warranted;
        
        
 Whereas the memo did not provide an explanation of how these determinations were reached, nor did it specify which documents had been reviewed or why materials earlier described as forthcoming were now being withheld;
        
        
 Whereas this abrupt reversal, paired with a lack of accountability or clarification from leadership in the Department of Justice, has fueled further speculation, intensified misinformation, and contributed to a public perception that political considerations, not legal standards, are governing disclosure decisions;
        
        
 Whereas victims of the abuse carried out by Epstein or related to his trafficking network, along with the broader public, deserve clarity on what happened, how evidence has been handled, and whether any institutional failures contributed to the delayed or incomplete pursuit of justice;
        
        
 Whereas public trust in the Department of Justice depends on consistent, fact-based communications and a demonstrated commitment to accountability that transcends political pressure;
        
        
 Whereas the disclosure of non-sensitive materials, such as timelines, investigatory summaries, indices of sealed filings, and previously released documents in structured formats, would serve the public interest while protecting the privacy and dignity of victims; and
        
        
 Whereas the responsible release of information ensures that public institutions are transparent, credible, and accountable to the people they serve: Now, therefore, be it
        
    
    
        
 That it is the sense of the Senate that—  (1) prior to any other action related to the investigation of Jeffery Epstein (referred to in this resolving clause as the Epstein investigation), the Department of Justice should meet with the identified victims of Jeffery Epstein and their representatives to answer questions about the investigations and prosecutions related to the Epstein investigation and to provide the materials the Department of Justice intends to make public;
            
            
                (2)
 the Department of Justice should publicly clarify the full scope of materials in its possession related to the Epstein investigation, including which materials have been reviewed and which remain under seal;
            
            
                (3)
 the Department of Justice should release all appropriate records related to the Epstein investigation, such as flight manifests, investigatory summaries, chain-of-custody documentation, and any material previously entered into the public record but not widely disseminated;
            
            
                (4)
 any internal memos or legal analyses justifying the withholding of materials related to the Epstein investigation should be released, in redacted form where appropriate, to clarify the basis for the determinations of the Department of Justice and protect the identity of victims;
            
            
                (5)
 the Department of Justice must correct prior misleading or inaccurate statements by senior officials of the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation regarding the existence of certain records, timelines for review, and commitments to transparency, related to the Epstein investigation;
            
            
                (6)
 public officials have a responsibility to communicate accurately and responsibly, particularly in matters involving victims of sex trafficking and public corruption, and failure to do so undermines faith in the justice system;
            
            
                (7)
 the Senate reaffirms its support for full accountability regarding the Epstein investigation, including the identification of any co-conspirators, public or private, whose conduct was criminal, and calls upon the Department of Justice to explain what steps, if any, it has taken to pursue such co-conspirators;
            
            
                (8)
 the Department of Justice should prioritize victim protection in any future disclosures, including by redacting personal information, withholding identifying images, and ensuring that materials cannot be used to re-traumatize victims or incite harassment; and
            
            
                (9)
 the Senate recognizes that truth and transparency are essential to countering misinformation, preventing future abuse, and preserving the integrity of public institutions and the justice system.
