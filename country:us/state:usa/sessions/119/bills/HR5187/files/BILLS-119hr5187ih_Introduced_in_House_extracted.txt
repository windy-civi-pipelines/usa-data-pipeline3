1.Bioindustrial commercialization program 
(a)In generalNot later than one year after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense may establish a program to support the expansion of the domestic capacity for bioindustrial manufacturing of critical biomanufactured products at a commercial level through awards to eligible entities for establishing, upgrading, and retooling of eligible bioindustrial manufacturing facilities. (b)Awards (1)In generalAn entity seeking an award under the program shall submit to the Secretary an application at such time, in such manner, and containing such information as the Secretary determines appropriate. 
(2)Competitive awardsThe Secretary shall make each award under the program to an eligible entity in a competitive manner. (3)Award criteriaIn selecting eligible entities to receive awards under the program, the Secretary shall consider the following criteria: 
(A)The potential of the technology of such eligible entity to improve domestic resilience and protect critical supply chains for critical biomanufactured products. (B)How the technology of such eligible entity could help meet the demand for the capabilities required by the next generation of warfighters. 
(C)The ability of the eligible bioindustrial manufacturing facility with respect to which such eligible entity is seeking such award to be repurposed and the range of products that such eligible bioindustrial manufacturing facility is capable of producing. (D)Whether the eligible bioindustrial manufacturing facility with respect to which such eligible entity is seeking such award supports the goal of wide geographic distribution of bioindustrial manufacturing facility across the United States. 

                        (E)
 Whether the eligible bioindustrial manufacturing facility with respect to which such eligible entity is seeking such award is located in geographic proximity to sources of input materials for the production of critical biomanufactured products or areas with established biomanfuacturing capabilities.
                     
(F)Such additional considerations that the Secretary deems appropriate. (4)Use of award fundsA recipient of an award under the program may use funds received under such award for the establishment, upgrading, or retooling of one or more eligible bioindustrial manufacturing facilities to produce critical biomanufactured products, including the development of business or technical plans related to such establishment, upgrading, or retooling. 
(c)OversightIf the Secretary establishes the program, the Secretary shall establish reporting requirements for recipients of awards under the program which shall include requirements for period reports on the following: (1)The progress of the recipient in establishing, upgrading, or retooling the eligible bioindustrial manufacturing facility with respect to which such recipient received such award.

(D)an explanation of how the establishment, upgrading, or retooling of the eligible bioindustrial manufacturing facility for which awards were made under the program aligns with priorities and needs of the Department of Defense and national security. (e)Sunset (1)In generalExcept as provided by paragraph (2), this section shall terminate on the date that is 10 years after the date of the enactment of this Act. 
(2)ExtensionThe Secretary may change the date on which this section terminates to a date that is later than the date on which this section would terminate under paragraph (1) if the President determines that the continuation of the program is necessary to meet national economic and national security needs. (f)DefinitionsIn this section: 
(1)The term biomanufacturing means the utilization of biological systems to develop new and advance existing products, tools, and processes at commercial scale. (2)The term critical biomanufactured product means a chemical, material, and other product that is manufactured using biomanufacturing and is relevant to the Department of Defense. 
(3)The term eligible bioindustrial manufacturing facility means a bioindustrial manufacturing facility that— (A)is or, if not yet established, will be located in the United States; and 
(B)is or, pursuant to an award under the program, will produce critical biomanufactured products. (4)The term eligible entity means an entity that— 
(A)is a private entity; (B)applied for an award under the program in accordance with subsection (b)(1); and
