McGuire Gravesite are intact and well-preserved.(18)National political and labor leaders have made annual pilgrimages to McGuire’s gravesite since 1906 and to the Peter J. McGuire Memorial and Peter J. McGuire Gravesite every September on Labor Day or the Friday before Labor Day since 1952.(19)Unlike other known properties related to McGuire, the Peter J. McGuire Memorial and Peter J. McGuire Gravesite are the only properties that retain both the necessary direct association with McGuire as a person of national stature and the high level of integrity required for listing on the New Jersey Register of Historic Places and National Register of Historic Places.(20)The Peter J. McGuire Memorial and Peter J. McGuire Gravesite satisfy the criteria for graves of historical figures and properties that have achieved significance within the past 50 years under the following criteria consideration categories of the National Register of Historic Places—(A)category (c), a grave of a historical figure of outstanding importance as there is no appropriate site or building associated with McGuire’s productive life; and(B)category (f), a property primarily commemorative in intent if design, age, tradition, or symbolic value has invested it with its own exceptional significance.(21)In August 2017, the New Jersey State Historic Preservation Office certified that the Peter J.
