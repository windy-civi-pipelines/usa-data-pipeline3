specified child of—(i)the parent with whom the child resided for the longest period of time during such month, or(ii)if the child resides with both parents for the same amount of time during such month, the parent with the highest adjusted gross income for the taxable year which includes such month.(C)Specified relativeFor purposes of this paragraph, the term specified relative means an

adjusted gross income of the taxpayer (with respect to whom such individual would be treated as a specified child after application of this subparagraph) for the taxable year which includes such month

parent and any specified relative with respect to whom such individual is not a specified child, determined without regard to subparagraphs (A) and (B) and after application of this subparagraph).(E)Treatment of joint returnsFor purposes of this paragraph, with respect to any month, the adjusted gross income of each person who files a joint return for the taxable year which

specified child of any other taxpayer with respect to whom a period of presumptive eligibility has not been established for any such month.(B)Ability of credit claimants to establish presumptive eligibilityNothing in section 7527A(c) shall be interpreted to preclude a taxpayer from establishing a period of presumptive eligibility (including any period described in subparagraph (D) with respect to which payment could be made) with respect to any specified child for purposes of this section solely because such taxpayer affirmatively elects not to receive monthly advance child payments under section 7527A.(C)Exception for income-based tie-breaker rulesIf a period of presumptive eligibility is established under section 7527A(c) for any individual with respect to any taxpayer and such

which there was a final determination that the taxpayer’s claim of credit under this section or section 24 (or payment received under section 7527A) was due to reckless or intentional disregard of

of the deficiency procedures under subchapter B of chapter 63, no credit shall be allowed under this section for any subsequent taxable year (and no payment shall be made under section 7527A for any subsequent month) unless the taxpayer provides such information as the Secretary may require to demonstrate eligibility for such credit.(3)Coordination with possessions of the United StatesFor purposes of this subsection, a taxpayer’s claim of credit under this section or section 24 (or payment received under section 7527A) includes a claim of credit under this section or section 24 of the

Any increase in tax imposed on a taxpayer by reason of paragraph (2) of the income tax law of a jurisdiction other than the United States shall be considered to reduce the aggregate amount of payments made to such taxpayer by such jurisdiction.

credit shall be allowed under this section for any taxable year to any individual to whom a credit is allowable against taxes imposed by a possession of the United States with a mirror code tax system by reason of the application of this section in such possession for such taxable year.(C)Mirror code tax systemFor purposes of this paragraph, the term mirror code tax system means, with respect to any possession of the United States, the income tax system of such possession if the income tax liability of the residents of such possession under such system is determined by reference to the income tax laws of the United States as if such possession were the United States.(2)Cross references related to application of credit to residents of Puerto Rico(A)For application of refundable credit to residents of Puerto Rico, see subsection (d).(B)For application of advance payment to residents of Puerto Rico, see section 7527A(b)(5).(3)American Samoa(A)In generalThe Secretary shall pay to American Samoa amounts estimated by the Secretary as being equal to the aggregate benefits that would have been provided to residents of American Samoa by reason of the application of this section for taxable years beginning in calendar years after 2024 if the provisions of this section had been in effect in American Samoa (applied as if American Samoa were the United States and without regard to the application of this section to residents of Puerto Rico under subsection (d)).(B)Distribution requirementSubparagraph (A) shall not apply unless American Samoa has a plan, which has been approved

principal place of abode for any month is different from the principal place of abode used for determining the monthly payment under section 7527A for such month.24B.Credit for certain other dependents(a)In generalThere shall be allowed as a credit against the tax imposed by this chapter for the taxable year an amount equal to $500 with respect to each specified dependent of such taxpayer

the taxpayer and such child,(4)the limitations of section 24A(b)(2) were applied with respect to the reference taxable year rather than with respect to the applicable taxable year, and(5)no monthly specified child allowance were determined with respect to such taxpayer for such calendar month unless the taxpayer (in the case of a joint return, either spouse) has a principal place of abode (determined as provided in section 32) in the United States or Puerto Rico for more than one-half of the reference month.(c)Period of presumptive eligibility(1)In generalFor purposes of this section, the term period of presumptive eligibility means, with respect to any taxpayer and any child, the period—(A)beginning with the calendar month following the calendar month during which the taxpayer provides the Secretary with sufficient information for the Secretary to—(i)determine that such child was a specified child of the taxpayer for the reference month (determined without regard to section 24A(c)(7)), and(ii)estimate the monthly advance child payment for such calendar month, and(B)ending with the earliest of—(i)the month beginning immediately after the month on which the Secretary sends the taxpayer a written notice that the taxpayer’s period of presumptive eligibility with respect to such child is being terminated by reason of information known to the Secretary (including a failure

payment with respect to such child is made after the calendar month in which such child is born, such payment is increased to properly take into account the months in such period of presumptive eligibility which precede the month in which such payment is made.(4)Presumptive eligibility based on certain government programsThe Secretary shall issue regulations or other guidance to establish procedures under which—(A)based on information provided to the Secretary by one or more government entities, a parent or specified relative of a child is treated as automatically establishing a period of presumptive eligibility with respect to such child, and(B)the month for which such period begins, the month by which the first annual renewal described in paragraph (2) must be completed, and any additional circumstances under which such period will terminate, are determined.(5)Taxpayer responsibility to notify SecretaryIn the event that any taxpayer is not allowed a monthly specified child allowance under section 24A(b) (determined without regard to section 24A(c)(7)) for any month in a period of presumptive eligibility with respect to such taxpayer, such taxpayer shall notify the Secretary under paragraph (1)(B)(ii) at such time and in such manner as the Secretary may provide.(6)Transition ruleWith respect periods of presumptive eligibility beginning during the first 6 months to which this section applies, the Secretary shall issue regulations or other guidance to establish procedures pursuant to which—(A)based on information known to the Secretary including returns of tax

such child, and(B)the month for which such period begins, the month by which the first annual renewal described in paragraph (2) must be completed, and any additional circumstances under which such period will terminate, are determined.(d)Determination of reference month and reference taxable yearFor purposes of this section—(1)Reference monthThe term reference month means, with respect to any

to this subsection) be established with respect another taxpayer and such child (hereafter referred to as the challenge claim), and the period of such challenge claim would overlap with the period of
