Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Women’s Health Protection Act of 2025.

Section 2:
2.PurposeThe purposes of this Act are as follows:(1)To permit people to seek and obtain abortion services, and to permit health care providers to provide abortion services, without harmful or unwarranted limitations or requirements that single out the provision of abortion services for restrictions that are more burdensome than those restrictions imposed on medically comparable procedures, do not, on the basis of the weight of established clinical practice guidelines consistent with medical evidence, significantly advance reproductive health or the safety of abortion services, or make abortion services more difficult to access.(2)To promote access to abortion services and thereby protect women’s ability to participate equally in the economic and social life of the United States.(3)To protect people’s ability to make decisions about their bodies, medical care, family, and life’s course.(4)To eliminate unwarranted burdens on commerce and the right to travel. Abortion bans and restrictions invariably affect commerce over which the United States has jurisdiction. Health care providers engage in economic and commercial activity when they provide abortion services. Moreover, there is an interstate market for abortion services and, in order to provide such services, health care providers engage in interstate commerce to purchase medicine, medical equipment, and other necessary goods and services; to obtain and provide training; and to employ and obtain commercial services from health care personnel, many of whom themselves engage in interstate commerce, including by traveling across State lines. Individuals engage in the interstate market by purchasing abortion services, including the purchase, use, and consumption of medicine, medical equipment, and other necessary goods and services transited in the stream of interstate commerce, the receipt of telemedicine services, and traveling across State lines to purchase and receive abortion services or assist others in purchasing or receiving such services. The increase in abortion prohibitions and restrictions in a subset of States since 2022 cause women to travel to other States for abortion care, which, in turn, affects the health care systems of those States that provide the treatment and has exponentially increased the burden on interstate commerce and the instrumentalities of interstate commerce. Congress has the authority to enact this Act to protect access to abortion services pursuant to—
                    (A)
 its powers under the commerce clause of section 8 of Article I of the Constitution of the United States;
 (B)its powers under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States to enforce the provisions of section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment; and
                    (C)
 its powers under the necessary and proper clause of section 8 of Article I of the Constitution of the United States.

Section 3:
3.DefinitionsIn this Act:(1)Abortion servicesThe term abortion services means an abortion and any medical or non-medical services related to and provided in conjunction with an abortion (whether or not provided at the same time or on the same day as the abortion).(2)GovernmentThe term government includes each branch, department, agency, instrumentality, and official of the United States or a State.(3)Health care providerThe term health care provider means any entity (including any hospital, clinic, or pharmacy (whether physical, mobile, or virtual)) or individual (including any physician, certified nurse-midwife, nurse practitioner, advanced practice clinician, registered nurse, pharmacist, or physician assistant) that—(A)is engaged or seeks to engage in the delivery of health care services, including abortion services; and(B)if required by law or regulation to be licensed or certified to engage in the delivery of such services—(i)is so licensed or certified; or(ii)would be so licensed or certified but for their past, present, or potential provision of abortion services protected by section 4.(4)Medically comparable proceduresThe term medically comparable procedures means medical procedures that are similar, on the basis of the weight of established clinical practice guidelines consistent with medical evidence, in terms of health and safety risks to the patient, complexity, or the clinical setting that is indicated.(5)PregnancyThe term pregnancy refers to the period of the human reproductive process beginning with the implantation of a fertilized egg.(6)StateThe term State includes the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and each territory and possession of the United States, and any subdivision of any of the foregoing, including any unit of local government, such as a county, city, town, village, or other general purpose political subdivision of a State.(7)ViabilityThe term viability means the point in a pregnancy at which, in the good-faith medical judgment of the treating health care provider, and based on the particular facts of the case before the health care provider, there is a reasonable likelihood of sustained fetal survival outside the uterus with or without artificial support.

Section 4:
4.Protected activities and services(a)General rules(1)Pre-viabilityA health care provider has a right under this Act to provide such abortion services, and a patient has a corresponding right under this Act to terminate a pregnancy prior to viability without being subject to any of the following limitations or requirements:(A)A prohibition on abortion prior to viability, including a prohibition or restriction on a particular abortion procedure or method, or a prohibition on providing or obtaining such abortions.(B)A limitation on a health care provider’s ability to prescribe or dispense drugs that could be used for reproductive health purposes based on current evidence-based regimens or the provider’s good-faith medical judgment, or a limitation on a patient’s ability to receive or use such drugs, other than a limitation generally applicable to the prescription, dispensing, or distribution of drugs.(C)A limitation on a health care provider’s ability to provide, or a patient’s ability to receive, abortion services via telemedicine, other than a limitation generally applicable to the provision of medically comparable services via telemedicine.(D)A limitation or prohibition on a patient’s ability to receive, or a provider’s ability to provide, abortion services in a State based on the State of residency of the patient, or a prohibition or limitation on the ability of any individual to assist or support a patient seeking abortion.(E)A requirement that a health care provider perform specific tests or medical procedures in connection with the provision of abortion services (including prior to or subsequent to the abortion), unless such tests or procedures are standard to the weight of established clinical practice guidelines consistent with medical evidence pertaining to abortion services.(F)A requirement that a health care provider offer or provide a patient seeking abortion services medically inaccurate information that is not compatible with the weight of established clinical practice guidelines.(G)A limitation or requirement concerning the physical plant, equipment, staffing, or hospital transfer arrangements of facilities where abortion services are provided, or the credentials or hospital privileges or status of personnel at such facilities, that is not imposed on facilities or the personnel of facilities where medically comparable procedures are performed.(H)A requirement that, prior to obtaining an abortion, a patient make one or more medically unnecessary in-person visits to the provider of abortion services or to any individual or entity that does not provide abortion services.(I)A limitation on a health care provider’s ability to provide immediate abortion services when that health care provider believes, based on the good-faith medical judgment of the provider, that delay would pose a risk to the patient’s life or health.(J)A requirement that a patient seeking abortion services at any point or points in time prior to viability disclose the patient’s reason or reasons for seeking abortion services, or a limitation on providing or obtaining abortion services at any point or points in time prior to viability based on any actual, perceived, or potential reason or reasons of the patient for obtaining abortion services, regardless of whether the limitation is based on a health care provider’s actual or constructive knowledge of such reason or reasons.(2)Post-viability(A)In generalA health care provider has a right under this Act to provide abortion services and a patient has a corresponding right under this Act to terminate a pregnancy after viability when, in the good-faith medical judgement of the treating health care provider, it is necessary to protect the life or health of the patient. This subparagraph shall not otherwise apply after viability.(B)Additional circumstancesA State may provide additional circumstances under which post viability abortions are permitted.(C)LimitationIn the case where a termination of a pregnancy after viability, in the good-faith medical judgement of the treating health care provider, is necessary to protect the life or health of the patient, none of the limitations or requirements described in paragraph (1) shall be imposed by law.(b)Other limitations or requirementsThe rights described in subsection (a) shall not be limited or otherwise infringed through any other limitation or requirement that—(1)expressly, effectively, implicitly, or as implemented, targets abortion, the provision of abortion services, individuals who seek abortion services or who provide assistance and support to those seeking abortion services, health care providers who provide abortion services, or facilities in which abortion services are provided; and(2)impedes access to abortion services.(c)Factors for considerationA court may consider the following factors, among others, in determining whether a limitation or requirement impedes access to abortion services for purposes of subsection (b)(2):(1)Whether the limitation or requirement, in a provider’s good-faith medical judgment, interferes with a health care provider’s ability to provide care and render services, or poses a risk to the patient’s health or safety.(2)Whether the limitation or requirement is reasonably likely to delay or deter a patient in accessing abortion services.(3)Whether the limitation or requirement is reasonably likely to directly or indirectly increase the cost of providing abortion services or the cost for obtaining abortion services such as costs associated with travel, childcare, or time off work.(4)Whether the limitation or requirement is reasonably likely to have the effect of necessitating patient travel that would not otherwise have been required, including by making it necessary for a patient to travel out of State to obtain services.(5)Whether the limitation or requirement is reasonably likely to result in a decrease in the availability of abortion services in a given State or geographic region.(6)Whether the limitation or requirement imposes penalties that are not imposed on other health care providers for comparable conduct or failure to act, or that are more severe than penalties imposed on other health care providers for comparable conduct or failure to act.(7)The cumulative impact of the limitation or requirement combined with other limitations or requirements.(d)ExceptionTo defend against a claim that a limitation or requirement violates a health care provider’s or patient’s rights under subsection (b) a party must establish, by clear and convincing evidence, that the limitation or requirement is essential to significantly advance the safety of abortion services or the health of patients and that the safety or health objective cannot be accomplished by a different means that does not interfere with the right protected under subsection (b).

Section 5:
5.Protection of the right to travelA person has a fundamental right under the Constitution of the United States and this Act to travel to a State other than the person’s State of residence, including to obtain reproductive health services such as prenatal, childbirth, fertility, and abortion services, and a person has a right under this Act to assist another person to obtain such services or otherwise exercise the right described in this section.
