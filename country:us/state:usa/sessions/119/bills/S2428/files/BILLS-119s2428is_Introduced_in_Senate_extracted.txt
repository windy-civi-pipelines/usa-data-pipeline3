Section 1:
1.
            Short title
 This Act may be cited as the Stopping Teachers Unions from Damaging Education Needs Today Act or the STUDENT Act.

Section 2:
2.
            Findings
 Congress finds the following:  (1) The National Education Association (referred to in this section as the NEA) was chartered in 1906 by an Act of Congress (34 Stat. 804, chapter 3929) to elevate the character and advance the interests of the profession of teaching; and to promote the cause of education in the United States (36 U.S.C. 151102) and remains the only labor union that has a Federal charter.
            
            
                (2)
 By continuing to hold its Federal charter, the NEA’s actions and advocacy effectively receive Congress’ seal of approval.
            
            
                (3)
 The NEA can no longer be considered a patriotic or national organization worthy of its Federal charter as it has drifted substantially from its core mission and become a massive political operation dedicated to electing Democrats and imposing a radical progressive agenda on the schools of the United States.
            
            
                (4)
 In July 2019, NEA members held an assembly and voted against adding a business item to the organization that stated: The National Education Association will rededicate itself to the pursuit of increased student learning in every public school in America by putting a renewed emphasis on quality education. NEA will make student learning the priority of the association.
            
            
                (5)
 In the same assembly, NEA members voted in support of the right to an abortion, supporting illegal immigration, and expanding professional development for educators to help create student Gender Sexuality Alliance clubs.
            
            
                (6)
 According to disclosures made to the Office of Labor-Management Standards, from September 2019 to August 2021, the NEA spent over $116,700,000 on political activities and lobbying, and in the 2020 election cycle, 95.7 percent of candidate campaign contributions by the NEA went to Democrat candidates.
            
            
                (7)
 The NEA adopted measures in July 2021 to support critical race theory, calling it reasonable and appropriate, and to spend $56,500 on researching and shaming organizations fighting the inclusion of critical race theory in schools.
            
            
                (8)
 The NEA and other teacher unions stood in the way of reopening schools in 2020 and 2021 by threatening strikes, donating to Democrat candidates that backed school closures, and influencing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance to make it harder for schools to reopen.
            
            
                (9)
 In July 2025, NEA members held an assembly and voted to cut ties with the Anti-Defamation League (referred to in this section as the ADL) due to the ADL’s position on Israel and countering antisemitism. Cutting ties would mean no longer using ADL materials on antisemitism and Holocaust education nor promoting the ADL’s statistics or programs.
            
            
                (10)
 At the same assembly, the NEA members voted to refer to President Donald J. Trump’s policies as fascism.

        II
        119th CONGRESS
        1st Session
        S. 2428
        IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
        
            July 24, 2025
            Ms. Lummis (for herself, Mr. Risch, Mr.
                    Ricketts, Mr. Sheehy, and
                    Mr. Cruz) introduced the following bill;
                which was read twice and referred to the Committee on Finance
        
        A BILL
        To amend chapter 1511 of title 36, United States Code, to impose certain
            requirements on the National Education Association, and for other
            purposes.
    
    
        
            1.
            Short title
 This Act may be cited as the Stopping Teachers Unions from Damaging Education Needs Today Act or the STUDENT Act.
        
        
            2.
            Findings
 Congress finds the following:  (1) The National Education Association (referred to in this section as the NEA) was chartered in 1906 by an Act of Congress (34 Stat. 804, chapter 3929) to elevate the character and advance the interests of the profession of teaching; and to promote the cause of education in the United States (36 U.S.C. 151102) and remains the only labor union that has a Federal charter.
            
            
                (2)
 By continuing to hold its Federal charter, the NEA’s actions and advocacy effectively receive Congress’ seal of approval.
            
            
                (3)
 The NEA can no longer be considered a patriotic or national organization worthy of its Federal charter as it has drifted substantially from its core mission and become a massive political operation dedicated to electing Democrats and imposing a radical progressive agenda on the schools of the United States.
            
            
                (4)
 In July 2019, NEA members held an assembly and voted against adding a business item to the organization that stated: The National Education Association will rededicate itself to the pursuit of increased student learning in every public school in America by putting a renewed emphasis on quality education. NEA will make student learning the priority of the association.
            
            
                (5)
 In the same assembly, NEA members voted in support of the right to an abortion, supporting illegal immigration, and expanding professional development for educators to help create student Gender Sexuality Alliance clubs.
            
            
                (6)
 According to disclosures made to the Office of Labor-Management Standards, from September 2019 to August 2021, the NEA spent over $116,700,000 on political activities and lobbying, and in the 2020 election cycle, 95.7 percent of candidate campaign contributions by the NEA went to Democrat candidates.
            
            
                (7)
 The NEA adopted measures in July 2021 to support critical race theory, calling it reasonable and appropriate, and to spend $56,500 on researching and shaming organizations fighting the inclusion of critical race theory in schools.
            
            
                (8)
 The NEA and other teacher unions stood in the way of reopening schools in 2020 and 2021 by threatening strikes, donating to Democrat candidates that backed school closures, and influencing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance to make it harder for schools to reopen.
            
            
                (9)
 In July 2025, NEA members held an assembly and voted to cut ties with the Anti-Defamation League (referred to in this section as the ADL) due to the ADL’s position on Israel and countering antisemitism. Cutting ties would mean no longer using ADL materials on antisemitism and Holocaust education nor promoting the ADL’s statistics or programs.
            
            
                (10)
 At the same assembly, the NEA members voted to refer to President Donald J. Trump’s policies as fascism.
