Since the military activity in Vieques, island residents have suffered from the health impacts from long-term exposure to environmental contamination as a result of 62 years of military operations, and have experienced higher rates of certain diseases among residents, including cancer, cirrhosis, hypertension, diabetes, heavy metal diseases, along with many unnamed and uncategorized illnesses. These toxic residues have caused the American residents of Vieques to develop illnesses due to ongoing exposure.</text></paragraph>

Vieques needs a medical facility that can treat and address the critical and urgent need to get lifesaving medical services to its residents. Due to legal restrictions, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (in this Act referred to as <quote>FEMA</quote>) is unable to provide a hospital where its capabilities exceed the abilities of the facility that existed prior to Maria; therefore, Vieques needs assistance to build a facility to manage the vast health needs of its residents.</text></paragraph> <paragraph commented="no" display-inline="no-display-inline" id="id92e83ed834be47279bda46d30392a888"><enum>(10)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Every American has benefitted from the sacrifices of those Americans who have lived and are living on Vieques and it is our intent to acknowledge that sacrifice and to treat those Americans with the same respect and appreciation that other Americans enjoy.</text></paragraph>
