Section 1:
1.Short title
 This Act may be cited as the Compliant Operations of Decentralized Entities Act of 2025 or the the CODE Act of 2025.

Section 2:
2.FindingsThe Congress finds the following:  (1) In 2019, under the Trump Administration, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network issued guidance (FIN–2019–G001) to clarify that decentralized finance applications may be required to register with the agency and comply with the Bank Secrecy Act, including anti-money laundering, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements.
       

        (2)
 In 2019, under the Trump Administration, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network published an advisory (FIN–2019–A003) noting that the prevalence of unregistered cryptocurrency entities without sufficient anti-money laundering controls enables illicit activity that threatens national security.
       

        (3)
 In 2022, under the Biden Administration, the Federal Bureau of Investigation published a public service announcement (I–082922–PSA) encouraging decentralized finance services to institute real-time analytics, monitoring, and rigorous testing of the computer code to more quickly identify vulnerabilities and respond to indicators of suspicious activity.
       
(4)In 2023, under the Biden Administration, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission issued a report (Decentralized Finance), advocating for building regulatory compliance into decentralized finance systems and noting that areas like illicit finance compliance and cybersecurity are ripe for this kind of near-term action by software developers. (5)Decentralized finance services may be subject to Bank Secrecy Act requirements, but there is a lack of standardization across decentralized finance services and compliance processes. 
(6)Decentralized finance services present unique cybersecurity risks and have been vulnerable to exploitation campaigns by North Korean threat actors. (7)Decentralized finance services and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem could benefit from a set of technological controls that are coherent, consistent, and capable of satisfying Bank Secrecy Act requirements.

Section 3:

(4)consider establishing a regulatory gateway to external, verifiable data inputs and outputs that are capable of upgrading smart contract behavior after it has been deployed; and (5)provide legislative and regulatory recommendations related to integrated compliance mechanisms for decentralized finance services.
