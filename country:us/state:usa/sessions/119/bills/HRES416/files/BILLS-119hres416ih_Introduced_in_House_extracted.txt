IV119th CONGRESS1st SessionH. RES. 416IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESMay 15, 2025Mrs. Beatty submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and CommerceRESOLUTIONExpressing support for the goals and ideals of National Hypertension Awareness Month.
Whereas hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, affects nearly half of all adults in the United States and is a leading risk factor for various cardiovascular diseases; Whereas hypertension often goes undetected and untreated, leading to severe health complications, including heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure and contributing to nearly 500,000 deaths per year in the United States;
Whereas only about 1 in 4 adults in the United States has their hypertension under control; Whereas health care costs in the United States associated with hypertension account for about $131,000,000,000 per year, and individuals with hypertension are estimated to face nearly $2,000 higher annual health care expenditures compared to those without hypertension;
Whereas hypertension disproportionately impacts certain populations, including but not limited to communities of color, socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals, and those with limited access to health care services, and this leads to health disparities and inequities in the prevalence, management, and outcomes of high blood pressure; Whereas early detection, proper management, and access to medical treatments are critical to reducing the prevalence and impact of hypertension on individuals’ health and well-being;
Whereas medical technology and other medical advancements continue to advance new therapies and promising treatments to reduce blood pressure and improve cardiovascular outcomes; Whereas the month of May is dedicated to raising awareness about hypertension, promoting education about prevention and management, and encouraging individuals to monitor their blood pressure regularly;
Whereas access to affordable and quality health care services, including medical treatments, is crucial for managing hypertension and improving health outcomes; and Whereas community initiatives, health care professionals, public health agencies, and advocacy organizations play a vital role in educating the public, providing resources, and advocating for policies that enhance hypertension awareness and access to medical care: Now, therefore, be it 
That the House of Representatives— (1)expresses support for the designation of Hypertension Awareness Month;
(2)acknowledges the importance of raising awareness about hypertension risks, prevention, and management strategies; (3)encourages health care providers, public health agencies, and community organizations to continue their efforts in educating and empowering individuals to monitor and manage their blood pressure effectively;
(4)emphasizes the significance of access to affordable and comprehensive health care services, including medical treatments, to addressing hypertension and reducing its impact on individuals and communities; (5)supports initiatives that aim to improve health care access, affordability, and education regarding hypertension management and treatment options; and
(6)expresses its appreciation to health care professionals, researchers, advocates, and organizations committed to reducing the burden of hypertension and improving public health.
