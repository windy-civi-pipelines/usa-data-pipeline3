Section 2:
2. Findings Congress finds the following:
            
                (1)
 Artificial intelligence systems are products that shift decision-making power and responsibility away from humans to software-based systems, often without direct human oversight.
            
            
                (2)
 These products, while holding great promise, have caused and will cause harm to businesses and individuals. For example, multiple teenagers have tragically died after being exploited by an artificial intelligence chatbot.
            
            
                (3)
 Unpredictable allocations of liability jeopardize public safety and the financial well-being of both individuals and entire industries, particularly the small businesses of the United States, and adversely affect the Federal Government and taxpayers.
            
            
                (4)
 Product liability law can help to address harms caused by artificial intelligence systems that affect interstate commerce by incentivizing safety, providing certainty to artificial intelligence developers and deployers to continue to innovate, and ensuring the competitiveness of the United States.
            
            
                (5)
 A Federal products liability framework for artificial intelligence systems will remove barriers to interstate commerce and protect individuals’ due process rights.
            
            
                (6)
 This Act establishes Federal legislative guidelines for products liability without implicating expressive speech to ensure more predictable legal outcomes for individuals and industries and promotes business innovation.

Section 4:
101.
                Developer liability for harm to business or consumer
                
                    (a)
                    In general
 In any liability action, the developer shall be liable to a claimant if the claimant establishes by a preponderance of the evidence—
                    
                        (1)
 that—  (A) the developer failed to exercise reasonable care with respect to the design of the covered product; and
                        
                        
                            (B)
 the failure to exercise reasonable care was a proximate cause of harm to the claimant;
                        
                    
                    
                        (2)
 that—  (A) the developer failed to exercise reasonable care with respect to providing adequate instructions or warnings applicable to the covered product that allegedly caused the harm that is the subject of the complaint; and
                        
                        
                            (B)
 the failure to exercise reasonable care with respect to providing adequate instructions or warnings was a proximate cause of harm to the claimant;
                        
                    
                    
                        (3)
 that—  (A) the developer made an express warranty applicable to the covered product that allegedly caused the harm that is the subject of the complaint;
                        
                        
                            (B)
 the covered product failed to conform to the warranty; and   (C) the failure of the covered product to conform to the warranty was a proximate cause of harm to the claimant; or
                        
                    
                    
                        (4)
 that—  (A) the covered product was, at the time of sale or distribution, in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous when used or misused in a reasonably foreseeable manner; and
                        
                        
                            (B)
 the defective condition was a proximate cause of the harm to the claimant.
                        
                    
                
                
                    (b)
                    Defective design
                    
                        (1)
                        In general
 In any liability action against a developer alleging that a covered product is unreasonably dangerous because of a defective design, as described in subsection (a)(1), the claimant shall be required to prove that, at the time of sale or distribution of the covered product by the developer, the foreseeable risks of harm posed by the covered product could have been reduced or avoided by the adoption of a reasonable alternative design by the developer, and the omission of the alternative design renders the covered product not reasonably safe.
                    
                    
                        (2)
                        Manifestly unreasonable design
 Notwithstanding paragraph (1), in a liability action described in that paragraph, if the design of a covered product is found to be manifestly unreasonable, a claimant shall not be required to prove the existence of a reasonable alternative design.
                    
                    
                        (3)
                        Circumstantial evidence supporting inference of covered product
                            defect
 In a liability action described in subsection (a)(1), it may be inferred that the harm sustained by the claimant was caused by a covered product defect existing at the time of sale or distribution, without proof of a specific defect, when the incident that harmed the claimant—
                        
                            (A)
 was of a kind that ordinarily occurs as a result of covered product defect; and
                        
                        
                            (B)
 was not, in the particular case, solely the result of causes other than covered product defect existing at the time of sale or distribution.
                        
                    
                    
                        (4)
                        Noncompliance and compliance with required covered product safety
                            statutes or regulations
                        
                            (A)
                            Noncompliance
 For purposes of a liability action described in subsection (a)(1), if a covered product does not comply with an applicable covered product safety statute or administrative regulation, the covered product shall be deemed defective with respect to the risks sought to be reduced by the statute or regulation.
                        
                        
                            (B)
                            Compliance
 For purposes of a liability action described in subsection (a)(1), the court may consider a covered product’s compliance with an applicable covered product safety statute or administrative regulation in determining whether the covered product is defective with respect to the risks sought to be reduced by the statute or regulation, but such compliance does not preclude as a matter of law a finding of covered product defect.
                        
                    
                
                
                    (c)
                    Failure to warn
                    
                        (1)
                        In general
 For purposes of a liability action described in subsection (a)(2), a covered product shall be considered defective because of inadequate instructions or warnings if—
                        
                            (A)
 the foreseeable risks of harm posed by the covered product could have been reduced or avoided by the provision of reasonable instructions or warnings by the developer; and
                        
                        
                            (B)
 the omission of the instructions or warnings renders the covered product not reasonably safe.
                        
                    
                    
                        (2)
                        Adequate instruction or warning
 For purposes of paragraph (1), an adequate instruction or warning is one that a reasonably prudent person in the same or similar circumstances would have provided with respect to a reasonably foreseeable risk and that communicates sufficient information on the reasonably foreseeable risks and safe use of the covered product, taking into account the characteristics of, and the ordinary knowledge common to, an ordinary user of the covered product.
                    
                    
                        (3)
                        Knowledge
 In a liability action described in subsection (a)(2), the claimant shall be required to prove that, at the time the covered product left the developer’s control, the developer knew of or, in light of then-existing scientific and technical knowledge, reasonably should have foreseen, the risk that caused the claimant’s harm.
                    
                    
                        (4)
                        Open and obvious
                        
                            (A)
                            In general
 In a liability action described in subsection (a)(2), a developer shall not be liable for failure to instruct or warn about a foreseeable risk that is open and obvious to the user of the covered product, taking into account the characteristics of, and the ordinary knowledge common to, an ordinary user of the covered product.
                        
                        
                            (B)
                            Minors
 For purposes of subparagraph (A), a risk shall be presumed to not be open and obvious to a user of a covered product who is under 18 years old.
                        
                    
                    
                        (5)
                        Noncompliance and compliance with required covered product safety
                            statutes or regulations
                        
                            (A)
                            Noncompliance
 In a liability action described in subsection (a)(2), if a covered product does not comply with an applicable covered product safety statute or administrative regulation, the covered product shall be deemed defective due to inadequate instructions or warnings with respect to the risks sought to be reduced by the statute or regulation.
                        
                        
                            (B)
                            Compliance
 In a liability action described in subsection (a)(2), the court may consider a covered product’s compliance with an applicable covered product safety statute or administrative regulation in determining whether the covered product is defective due to inadequate instructions or warnings with respect to the risks sought to be reduced by the statute or regulation, but such compliance does not preclude as a matter of law a finding of covered product defect.
                        
                    
                
                
                    (d)
                    Strict liability of developer for unreasonably dangerous or defective
                        covered products
                    
                        (1)
                        In general
 In a liability action described in subsection (a)(4), the developer of a covered product shall be strictly liable for harm caused by the defective condition of the covered product, notwithstanding—
                        
                            (A)
 that the developer exercised all possible care in the design or distribution of the covered product; or

        S. 2937
        IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
        
            September 29, 2025
            Mr. Durbin (for himself and Mr. Hawley) introduced the following bill; which was
                read twice and referred to the Committee on
                    the Judiciary
        
        A BILL
        To establish legal standards for advanced artificial intelligence
            products.
    
    
        
            1.
            Short title; table of contents
            
                (a)
                Short title

                Table of contents
 The table of contents for this Act is as follows:  Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents. Sec. 2. Findings. Sec. 3. Definitions. TITLE I—Aligning incentives for safety, innovation and United States competitiveness Sec. 101. Developer liability for harm to business or consumer. Sec. 102.

TITLE V—Effective date Sec. 501. Effective date.     2. Findings Congress finds the following:
            
                (1)
 Artificial intelligence systems are products that shift decision-making power and responsibility away from humans to software-based systems, often without direct human oversight.
            
            
                (2)
 These products, while holding great promise, have caused and will cause harm to businesses and individuals. For example, multiple teenagers have tragically died after being exploited by an artificial intelligence chatbot.
            
            
                (3)
 Unpredictable allocations of liability jeopardize public safety and the financial well-being of both individuals and entire industries, particularly the small businesses of the United States, and adversely affect the Federal Government and taxpayers.
            
            
                (4)
 Product liability law can help to address harms caused by artificial intelligence systems that affect interstate commerce by incentivizing safety, providing certainty to artificial intelligence developers and deployers to continue to innovate, and ensuring the competitiveness of the United States.
            
            
                (5)
 A Federal products liability framework for artificial intelligence systems will remove barriers to interstate commerce and protect individuals’ due process rights.
            
            
                (6)
 This Act establishes Federal legislative guidelines for products liability without implicating expressive speech to ensure more predictable legal outcomes for individuals and industries and promotes business innovation.

                Developer liability for harm to business or consumer
                
                    (a)
                    In general
 In any liability action, the developer shall be liable to a claimant if the claimant establishes by a preponderance of the evidence—
                    
                        (1)
 that—  (A) the developer failed to exercise reasonable care with respect to the design of the covered product; and
                        
                        
                            (B)
 the failure to exercise reasonable care was a proximate cause of harm to the claimant;
                        
                    
                    
                        (2)
 that—  (A) the developer failed to exercise reasonable care with respect to providing adequate instructions or warnings applicable to the covered product that allegedly caused the harm that is the subject of the complaint; and
                        
                        
                            (B)
 the failure to exercise reasonable care with respect to providing adequate instructions or warnings was a proximate cause of harm to the claimant;
                        
                    
                    
                        (3)
 that—  (A) the developer made an express warranty applicable to the covered product that allegedly caused the harm that is the subject of the complaint;
                        
                        
                            (B)
 the covered product failed to conform to the warranty; and   (C) the failure of the covered product to conform to the warranty was a proximate cause of harm to the claimant; or
                        
                    
                    
                        (4)
 that—  (A) the covered product was, at the time of sale or distribution, in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous when used or misused in a reasonably foreseeable manner; and
                        
                        
                            (B)
 the defective condition was a proximate cause of the harm to the claimant.
                        
                    
                
                
                    (b)
                    Defective design
                    
                        (1)
                        In general
 In any liability action against a developer alleging that a covered product is unreasonably dangerous because of a defective design, as described in subsection (a)(1), the claimant shall be required to prove that, at the time of sale or distribution of the covered product by the developer, the foreseeable risks of harm posed by the covered product could have been reduced or avoided by the adoption of a reasonable alternative design by the developer, and the omission of the alternative design renders the covered product not reasonably safe.
                    
                    
                        (2)
                        Manifestly unreasonable design
 Notwithstanding paragraph (1), in a liability action described in that paragraph, if the design of a covered product is found to be manifestly unreasonable, a claimant shall not be required to prove the existence of a reasonable alternative design.
                    
                    
                        (3)
                        Circumstantial evidence supporting inference of covered product
                            defect
 In a liability action described in subsection (a)(1), it may be inferred that the harm sustained by the claimant was caused by a covered product defect existing at the time of sale or distribution, without proof of a specific defect, when the incident that harmed the claimant—
                        
                            (A)
 was of a kind that ordinarily occurs as a result of covered product defect; and
                        
                        
                            (B)
 was not, in the particular case, solely the result of causes other than covered product defect existing at the time of sale or distribution.
                        
                    
                    
                        (4)
                        Noncompliance and compliance with required covered product safety
                            statutes or regulations
                        
                            (A)
                            Noncompliance
 For purposes of a liability action described in subsection (a)(1), if a covered product does not comply with an applicable covered product safety statute or administrative regulation, the covered product shall be deemed defective with respect to the risks sought to be reduced by the statute or regulation.
                        
                        
                            (B)
                            Compliance
 For purposes of a liability action described in subsection (a)(1), the court may consider a covered product’s compliance with an applicable covered product safety statute or administrative regulation in determining whether the covered product is defective with respect to the risks sought to be reduced by the statute or regulation, but such compliance does not preclude as a matter of law a finding of covered product defect.
                        
                    
                
                
                    (c)
                    Failure to warn
                    
                        (1)
                        In general
 For purposes of a liability action described in subsection (a)(2), a covered product shall be considered defective because of inadequate instructions or warnings if—
                        
                            (A)
 the foreseeable risks of harm posed by the covered product could have been reduced or avoided by the provision of reasonable instructions or warnings by the developer; and
                        
                        
                            (B)
 the omission of the instructions or warnings renders the covered product not reasonably safe.
                        
                    
                    
                        (2)
                        Adequate instruction or warning
 For purposes of paragraph (1), an adequate instruction or warning is one that a reasonably prudent person in the same or similar circumstances would have provided with respect to a reasonably foreseeable risk and that communicates sufficient information on the reasonably foreseeable risks and safe use of the covered product, taking into account the characteristics of, and the ordinary knowledge common to, an ordinary user of the covered product.
                    
                    
                        (3)
                        Knowledge
 In a liability action described in subsection (a)(2), the claimant shall be required to prove that, at the time the covered product left the developer’s control, the developer knew of or, in light of then-existing scientific and technical knowledge, reasonably should have foreseen, the risk that caused the claimant’s harm.
                    
                    
                        (4)
                        Open and obvious
                        
                            (A)
                            In general
 In a liability action described in subsection (a)(2), a developer shall not be liable for failure to instruct or warn about a foreseeable risk that is open and obvious to the user of the covered product, taking into account the characteristics of, and the ordinary knowledge common to, an ordinary user of the covered product.
                        
                        
                            (B)
                            Minors
 For purposes of subparagraph (A), a risk shall be presumed to not be open and obvious to a user of a covered product who is under 18 years old.
                        
                    
                    
                        (5)
                        Noncompliance and compliance with required covered product safety
                            statutes or regulations
                        
                            (A)
                            Noncompliance
 In a liability action described in subsection (a)(2), if a covered product does not comply with an applicable covered product safety statute or administrative regulation, the covered product shall be deemed defective due to inadequate instructions or warnings with respect to the risks sought to be reduced by the statute or regulation.
                        
                        
                            (B)
                            Compliance
 In a liability action described in subsection (a)(2), the court may consider a covered product’s compliance with an applicable covered product safety statute or administrative regulation in determining whether the covered product is defective due to inadequate instructions or warnings with respect to the risks sought to be reduced by the statute or regulation, but such compliance does not preclude as a matter of law a finding of covered product defect.

                    Strict liability of developer for unreasonably dangerous or defective
                        covered products
                    
                        (1)
                        In general
 In a liability action described in subsection (a)(4), the developer of a covered product shall be strictly liable for harm caused by the defective condition of the covered product, notwithstanding—
                        
                            (A)
 that the developer exercised all possible care in the design or distribution of the covered product; or
                        
                        
                            (B)
 that the claimant did not purchase the covered product directly from the developer or otherwise enter into a contractual relationship with the developer.
                        
                    
                    
                        (2)
                        Substantial modification
 A developer shall not be liable under subsection (a)(4) for harm solely caused by a substantial modification.

                    (a)
                    In general
 A deployer shall be deemed to be liable as a developer under section 101 for harm caused by a covered product if—
                    
                        (1)
 the deployer makes a substantial modification to the covered product; or
                    
                    
                        (2)
 the deployer intentionally misuses the covered product contrary to its intended use and that misuse is the proximate cause of harm to the claimant.
                    
                
                
                    (b)
                    Use intended by developer is not modification or misuse
                    
                        (1)
                        In general
 For purposes of subsection (a), a use of a covered product that is intended by the developer of the covered product does not constitute a substantial modification to or misuse of the covered product.
                    
                    
                        (2)
                        Inference of intended use
 For purposes of paragraph (1), if a developer does not specify an intended use for a covered product, intended use shall be inferred by the targeted market and manner of distribution.
                    
                
                
                    (c)
                    Licensing
 Subject to section 302, any deployer licensing a covered product shall not be liable to a claimant for a violation of section 101 solely by reason of ownership or use of the covered product.

                    (a)
                    Standing in for the developer
 If the developer is not a party to a liability action because the developer is not subject to the court's jurisdiction, is insolvent, or cannot otherwise be made to answer for the harm, the deployer may be held liable to the same extent that the developer would have been liable under section 101.

 is subject to the court’s jurisdiction;
                        
                    
                    
                        (2)
 the developer is not insolvent or otherwise unable to satisfy any likely judgment; and
                    
                    
                        (3)
 the deployer is not otherwise liable under section 102.    (c) Joint fault  (1) In general If both the developer and the deployer contributed to the harm under sections 101 and 102, each person may be held jointly and severally liable for the portion of harm caused by that person's conduct.
                    
                    
                        (2)
                        Rule of construction

                        Right to seek indemnification
 A deployer that is held liable for harm caused by the developer under subsection (a) may pursue indemnification, including the recovery of attorney fees and litigation costs, from the developer.
                    
                    
                        (2)
                        Limitation
