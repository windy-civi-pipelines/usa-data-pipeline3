Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Medical Supply Chain Resiliency Act.

Section 2:
2.Findings; sense of Congress(a)FindingsCongress makes the following findings:(1)The COVID–19 pandemic created significant demand pressures on the global medical supply chain.(2)According to a December 2020 report by the United States International Trade Commission, global demand significantly exceeded available supply of many goods critical for the response to the COVID–19 pandemic (in this section referred to as COVID–19 critical goods). Health care providers in the United States faced difficulties in procuring such goods in sufficient quantities. Foreign export restrictions on finished drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients may have contributed to stress on the supply of some critical COVID–19 treatment drugs (including anti-infective products), as well as hormone medications and vitamins.(3)According to the McKinsey Global Institute, during the 20 years preceding the date of the enactment of this Act, pharmaceutical supply chains have become more globally dispersed and many generic small-molecule products have shifted to lower-cost production locations, some of which have been identified as posing a threat to the national security of the United States.(4)According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, while the United States is one of the largest exporters of COVID–19 critical goods, it is also one of the largest importers of those goods.(5)The World Trade Organization has found that, while the United States, Germany, and the People's Republic of China are all major producers and importers of COVID–19 critical goods, United States import partners are less diversified compared to Germany and the People's Republic of China. In the United States, more than half of its imports of COVID–19 critical goods came from only 3 partners—the People's Republic of China (30.6 percent), Mexico (15.3 percent), and Malaysia (9.0 percent).(6)While some of the countries in which medical supply manufacturing occurs are reliable suppliers and allies to the United States, others have adopted or maintained policies that make United States supply less secure.(b)Sense of CongressIt is the sense of Congress that, given the threat to national security and public health that could arise if the United States is unable to swiftly respond to significant demand surges for medical products in a future pandemic, it is critical that the United States diversify its trade relationships and prioritize partners that adopt and maintain reliable supply chain policies.

Section 3:
3.PurposesThe purposes of this Act are—(1)to improve overall medical supply chain resilience for the United States by establishing a framework to enhance medical supply chains with trusted trade partners;(2)to enhance supply chain security related to technology transfer and intellectual property protection;(3)to diversify and expand supplier networks to ensure a reliable supply of medical goods, especially in the event of emergency situations;(4)to eliminate unnecessary trade barriers and distortions that weaken or disrupt medical supply chains;(5)to expedite cross-border movement of critical medical goods;(6)to foster international collaboration, encourage new investments, promote cooperation and partnership in public and private research and development efforts, facilitate data flows for life science research and development, and expand manufacturing capacities for medical devices and pharmaceutical goods;(7)to promote regulatory cooperation with respect to manufacturing of medical goods;(8)to increase access to government procurement markets for medical goods;(9)to encourage adoption of and adherence to good regulatory practices related to medical goods;(10)to enable greater transparency, regulatory harmonization, and reliance in authorization and licensing procedures for medical devices and pharmaceutical goods;(11)to facilitate trade in medical goods to the most efficient and practicable extent possible; and(12)to identify current production capacities, address potential weaknesses, and improve overall resilience.
