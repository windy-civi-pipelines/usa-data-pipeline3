Whereas a community health worker is a frontline public health worker who is a trusted member, or has an unusually close understanding, of the community served; Whereas this trusting relationship enables the worker to serve as a liaison, link, or intermediary between health and social services and the community, facilitate access to services, improve the quality and cultural competence of service delivery, build individual and community capacity, and increase health knowledge and self-sufficiency through a range of activities such as outreach, community education, informal counseling, social support, and advocacy; 
Whereas community health workers are a unique workforce, recognized in 27 States with a professional certification; Whereas community health workers are a community-based workforce that builds relationships and capacity for health and well-being in underserved areas; 
Whereas community health workers are a historic and diverse workforce that goes back hundreds of years in the United States and reflects the diversity of the Nation; Whereas community health workers are known by more than 250 valued and respected titles, including community health representatives, promotores de salud, aunties, and outreach workers; 
Whereas community health workers are a cross-sector workforce that connects community members to health care and other social services, reducing barriers to health and well-being; Whereas community health workers are a proven workforce with decades of research documenting effectiveness in maternal and child health, chronic disease interventions, immunization, oral health, HIV, primary care, and many other disciplines, and have a documented return on investment for many programs; 
Whereas sustainable funding of community health workers supports fair market wages and enhanced recruitment and retention of the workforce; Whereas community health workers fulfill a wide range of roles, including— 
(1)providing cultural mediation among individuals, communities, and health and social service systems; (2)offering culturally appropriate health education and information; 
(3)offering care coordination, case management, and system navigation; (4)providing coaching and social support; 
(5)advocating for individuals and communities; (6)building individual and community capacity;
