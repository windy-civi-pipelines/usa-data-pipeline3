Whereas, since 1975, hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese fled the Vietnamese communist regime, resettled in the United States, and built vibrant communities across the United States which contribute to the rich diversity of the Nation; Whereas, on April 30, 1975, the Republic of Vietnam was overthrown by Communist forces in an event known as the Fall of Saigon; 
Whereas, every year on April 30, Vietnamese-American communities across the United States observe Black April as a solemn day of remembrance; Whereas Black April is known as Tháng Tư Đen in the Vietnamese language; 
Whereas the Fall of Saigon led to the forced displacement of millions of Vietnamese who sought refuge across the world; Whereas, in 1975, Congress passed the Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act (Public Law 94–23), allocating roughly $455,000,000 to facilitate the evacuation and resettlement of refugees from South Vietnam fleeing political persecution, oppression, and economic hardship; 
Whereas members of the South Vietnamese military fought side by side with the United States Armed Forces and troops from other allied nations in defense of the ideals of democracy, freedom, and human dignity; Whereas the evacuation of thousands of Vietnamese and Americans during Operation Frequent Wind stands as one of the most significant humanitarian efforts in modern United States military history; 
Whereas the United States carried out multiple subsequent aerial evacuation missions, including Operation Babylift, Operation New Life, and Operation New Arrivals, which collectively evacuated tens of thousands of Vietnamese refugees to the United States; Whereas the journey of Vietnamese refugees was marked by immense hardship, with many enduring perilous ocean voyages, time in refugee camps, and struggles of cultural adaptation; 
Whereas Vietnamese Americans persevered to build new lives and contribute to the social, economic, and political fabric of the United States; Whereas Vietnamese Americans have continuously advocated for freedom and democracy in Vietnam, and spoken out against human rights abuses by the Vietnamese Government; 
Whereas the Communist Party of Vietnam continues to hold one of the worst records on human rights in the region, violating religious freedom, obstructing freedom of press, restricting its own citizens’ freedom of speech and assembly, and detaining prisoners of conscience; Whereas, in 2023, the Vietnamese American community numbers over 2,300,000 people, becoming an integral part of American society and excelling in diverse fields such as public service, business, science, education, medicine, and the arts; and 
Whereas the customs of traditions of Vietnamese Americans are celebrated and deeply woven into the fabric of our Nation: Now, therefore, be it That the House of Representatives— 
(1)recognizes the significance of the 50th anniversary of Black April and the Fall of Saigon on April 30, 1975; (2)honors the contributions of Vietnamese Americans to the United States over the last 50 years and their tireless commitment to upholding freedom, human rights, and democracy in Vietnam; 
(3)reaffirms the commitment of the United States to upholding the values of democracy, human rights, and freedom for all people, including in Vietnam where people continue to seek enhanced civil liberties and freedom of press; (4)honors the service of members of the United States Armed Forces and the Army of the Republic of Vietnam who fought in the Vietnam war, including those who gave their lives; 
(5)honors the memory of the Vietnamese who lost their lives in search of freedom and democracy while attempting to flee Vietnam; and (6)encourages all citizens of the United States to join in commemorating Black April and the Fall of Saigon and honoring the contributions of the Vietnamese American community and indomitable spirit of the Vietnamese diaspora.
