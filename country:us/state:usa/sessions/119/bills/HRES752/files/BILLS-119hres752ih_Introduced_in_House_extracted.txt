IV119th CONGRESS1st SessionH. RES. 752IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESSeptember 19, 2025Mr. Lawler submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and CommerceRESOLUTIONExpressing support for the designation of September 19, 2025, as Black Autism Acceptance and Awareness Day. 
Whereas autism is a form of neurodivergence characterized by differences in social communication skills and by repetitive and highly focused behaviors and ways of thinking;  Whereas, despite recent efforts to serve Black autistic individuals, there appear to be significant racial inequities in the diagnosis and treatment of Black autistic children;
         
Whereas Black parents of autistic children reported significantly less autism concerns and behavioral concerns, with children more likely to be seen as disruptive instead of neurodivergent; Whereas Black autistic individuals are more likely to be misdiagnosed, underdiagnosed, and diagnosed late; 
Whereas Black autistic individuals are underrepresented in autism research; Whereas Black autistic individuals have been found to have more difficulty in accessing specialty care; 
Whereas the Black community reports more accounts of marginalization and dismissal of concerns in health care settings, including in the autism space; Whereas Black autistic youth face increased risk of negative outcomes during interactions with law enforcement; and 
Whereas Black autistic youth face disproportionate discipline at school, resulting in a higher prevalence of suspensions, expulsions, and other classroom punishments: Now, therefore, be it  That the House of Representatives— 

                (1)
 expresses support for the designation of Black Autism Acceptance and Awareness Day;
