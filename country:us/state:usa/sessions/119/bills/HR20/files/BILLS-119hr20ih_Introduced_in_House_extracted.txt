No action by the Board under this paragraph may be made until 30 days following the issuance of an order. Each separate violation of such an order shall be a separate offense, except that, in the case of a violation in which a person fails to obey or neglects to obey a final order of the Board, each day such failure or neglect continues shall be deemed a separate offense.(3)If, after having provided a person or entity with notice and an opportunity to be heard regarding a civil action under paragraph (2) for the enforcement of an order, the court determines that the order was regularly made and duly served, and that the person or entity is in disobedience of the same, the court shall enforce obedience to such order by an injunction or other proper process, mandatory or otherwise, to—(A)restrain such person or entity or the officers, agents, or representatives of such person or entity, from further disobedience to such order; or(B)enjoin such person or entity, officers, agents, or representatives to obedience to the same.;(4)in subsection (f)—(A)by striking proceed in the same manner as in the case of an application by the Board under subsection (e) of this section, and inserting proceed as provided under paragraph (2) of this subsection;(B)by striking Any and inserting the following:(1)Within 30 days of the issuance of an order, any; and(C)by adding at the end the following:(2)No objection that has not been urged before the Board, its member, agent, or agency shall be considered by a court, unless the failure or neglect to urge such objection shall be excused because of extraordinary circumstances.

If either party shall apply to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence and shall show to the satisfaction of the court that such additional evidence is material and that there were reasonable grounds for the failure to adduce such evidence in the hearing before the Board, its member, agent, or agency, the court may order such additional evidence to be taken before the Board, its member, agent, or agency, and to be made a part of the record. The Board may modify its findings as to the facts, or make new findings, by reason of additional evidence so taken and filed, and it shall file such modified or new findings, which findings with respect to questions of fact if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole shall be conclusive, and shall file its recommendations, if any, for the modification or setting aside of its original order.

If, after such investigation, the officer or regional attorney to whom the matter may be referred has reasonable cause to believe such charge is true and that a complaint should issue, such officer or attorney shall bring a petition for appropriate temporary relief or restraining order as set forth in paragraph (1). The district court shall grant the relief requested unless the court concludes that there is no reasonable likelihood that the Board will succeed on the merits of the Board’s claim.; and(2)by repealing subsections (k) and (l).109.Penalties(a)In generalSection 12 of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 162) is amended—(1)by striking Sec. 12.
