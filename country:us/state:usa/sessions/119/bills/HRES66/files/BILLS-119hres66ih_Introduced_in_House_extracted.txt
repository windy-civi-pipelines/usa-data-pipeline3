andWhereas Congress passed the bipartisan Reinforcing Education Accountability in Development (READ) Act (Division A, Public Law 115–56), in 2017 and reauthorized that bill in 2024 for an additional five fiscal years to demonstrate the United States Government’s commitment to improve access to education around the world and ensure individuals around the world have the education and skills needed to be productive members of society and the workforce: Now, therefore, be itThat the House of Representatives—(1)commends the leadership and commitment of the United States Government to improve access to quality, inclusive education and improved learning outcomes for the poorest and most marginalized children and adolescents worldwide, which promotes global stability, economic prosperity, and poverty elimination;(2)recognizes that the United States Government’s basic education programs are strengthened and complemented by Global Partnership for Education’s education systems-level approach and partnership building and Education Cannot Wait’s focus on education in emergencies and protracted crises;(3)acknowledges that education is a lifesaving humanitarian intervention and encourages the United States Government to integrate education in all humanitarian response efforts and continue to promote coordination across all sectors and branches of the United States Government;(4)implores the United States Government to meet its various commitments to international basic education through its annual budget requests to Congress, recognizing the significant global need;(5)calls on the Secretary of State and the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development to use all diplomatic, humanitarian, and development means to promote access to quality education for children and adolescents throughout the world;
