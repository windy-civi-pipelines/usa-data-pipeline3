Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Holocaust Insurance Accountability Act of 2025.

Section 2:
2.PurposesThe purposes of this Act are to—(1)allow for the enforcement of State laws requiring the disclosure of information about Holocaust-era insurance policies, notwithstanding the holding of the Supreme Court of the United States in American Insurance Association v. Garamendi, 539 U.S. 396 (2003) that such laws are preempted by the foreign policy espoused by the executive branch of the Federal Government addressed in that case;(2)facilitate the disclosure of information about Holocaust-era insurance policies under applicable State laws so that citizens of the United States (and other persons on whose behalf such laws were enacted) may know whether they hold any rights under the policies;(3)create a new Federal private cause of action and subject matter jurisdiction to allow the beneficiaries of Holocaust-era insurance policies, many of whom are citizens of the United States, to bring suits in the courts of the United States to recover any proceeds under the policies to which they may be entitled, notwithstanding the defense that such suits are preempted by the executive branch foreign policy addressed in Garamendi, with the State law of the forum or Federal common law providing the rule of decision governing the right of a beneficiary to recover under such policies;(4)foreclose defenses to claims brought under section 4 of this Act arising from any prior judgments or settlement agreements (including the class action judgment and settlement agreement (M21–89, United States District Court for the Southern District of New York) in In re: Assicurazioni General S.p.A. Holocaust Insurance Litigation) that were entered and approved based on the erroneous conclusion that State law claims to recover under Holocaust-era insurance claims are preempted by the executive branch foreign policy addressed in Garamendi;(5)provide for a uniform statute of limitations of 10 years after the date of enactment of this Act in any action to recover under Holocaust-era insurance policies under this Act or State law; and(6)in carrying out the purposes described in paragraphs (1) through (5), preserve the lawmaking powers of Congress under article I of the Constitution of the United States, with which the judicial decisions cited in this section are inconsistent.
