Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Neighborhood Homes Investment Act.

Section 2:
2.Findings and sense of Congress (a)FindingsCongress finds the following:
(1)Experts have determined that it could take nearly a decade to address the housing shortage in the United States, in large part due to increasing housing prices and insufficient supply. (2)The housing supply shortage disproportionately impacts low-income and distressed communities.
(3)Homeownership is a primary source of household wealth and neighborhood stability. Many distressed communities have low rates of homeownership and lack quality, affordable starter homes, while many individuals who own their homes have difficulty securing financing for home repairs and improvements. (4)Housing construction in distressed communities is prevented by the value gap, the difference between the cost to develop a home and the sale price of the home.
(5)The Neighborhood Homes Investment Act can close these financing gaps to increase housing development and rehabilitation in distressed communities. (b)Sense of CongressIt is the sense of Congress that the neighborhood homes credit (as added under section 3 of this Act) should be an activity administered in a manner which—
(1)revitalizes distressed communities in rural and urban geographies; (2)minimizes application burdens on small businesses applying for such credit; and
(3)is consistent with the Fair Housing Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq.).

I119th CONGRESS1st SessionH. R. 2854IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESApril 10, 2025Mr. Kelly of Pennsylvania (for himself, Mr. Larson of Connecticut, Mr. Carey, Ms. Sewell, Mr. Buchanan, Mr. Davis of Illinois, Mrs. Miller of West Virginia, Mr. Panetta, Mr. Feenstra, Mr. Kustoff, Ms. Malliotakis, and Mr. Moran) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on Ways and MeansA BILLTo amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to establish a tax credit for neighborhood revitalization, and for other purposes. 
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Neighborhood Homes Investment Act. 2.Findings and sense of Congress (a)FindingsCongress finds the following:
(1)Experts have determined that it could take nearly a decade to address the housing shortage in the United States, in large part due to increasing housing prices and insufficient supply. (2)The housing supply shortage disproportionately impacts low-income and distressed communities.
(3)Homeownership is a primary source of household wealth and neighborhood stability. Many distressed communities have low rates of homeownership and lack quality, affordable starter homes, while many individuals who own their homes have difficulty securing financing for home repairs and improvements. (4)Housing construction in distressed communities is prevented by the value gap, the difference between the cost to develop a home and the sale price of the home.
(5)The Neighborhood Homes Investment Act can close these financing gaps to increase housing development and rehabilitation in distressed communities. (b)Sense of CongressIt is the sense of Congress that the neighborhood homes credit (as added under section 3 of this Act) should be an activity administered in a manner which—
(1)revitalizes distressed communities in rural and urban geographies; (2)minimizes application burdens on small businesses applying for such credit; and
(3)is consistent with the Fair Housing Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq.). 3.Neighborhood homes credit (a)In generalSubpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by inserting after section 42 the following new section:

(ii)the sale price of such qualified residence (reduced by any reasonable expenses paid or incurred by the taxpayer in connection with such sale), or (B)if the neighborhood homes credit agency determines it is necessary to ensure financial feasibility, an amount not to exceed 120 percent of the amount under subparagraph (A),
(2)40 percent of the eligible development costs paid or incurred by the taxpayer with respect to such qualified residence, or (3)32 percent of the national median sale price for new homes (as determined pursuant to the most recent census data available as of the date on which the neighborhood homes credit agency makes an allocation for the qualified project).
