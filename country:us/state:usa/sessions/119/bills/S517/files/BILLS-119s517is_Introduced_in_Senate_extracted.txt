and(B)collected using means that ensure the confidentiality, in accordance with section 1770 of the Food Security Act of 1985 (7 U.S.C. 2276), of—(i)plot locations;(ii)nonaggregated data of woodland owners; and (iii)forest industry information.(9)Biennial compilationsBiennially, the Secretary shall prepare and make publicly available a compilation of national forest inventory and analysis forest statistics, which shall be similar to the tables contained in the Renewable Resource Assessments prepared under section 3(a) of the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974 (16 U.S.C. 1601(a)). (10)External complex data requests(A)In generalThe Secretary shall establish an office, a data platform, or both to process and respond to complex data requests submitted by external organizations relating to the program under this subsection.(B)FeesTo cover the costs of processing of and responding to complex data requests described in subparagraph (A), the Secretary may impose fees on the external organizations submitting the requests. (11)ReportsEach year, the Secretary shall publish as part of the forest inventory and analysis business report a detailed description of the progress of the Secretary in implementing the programmatic elements of the strategic plan described in paragraph (6), including—(A)the costs and priorities of the strategic plan; and (B)how the program under this subsection leverages new technology, improves and standardizes collection protocols, and increases workforce capacity..(b)Remote sensing technologiesSection 8632(1) of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (16 U.S.C. 1642 note; Public Law 115–334) is amended by striking technologies and inserting technologies, such as microwave, LiDAR, hyperspectral, and high-resolution remote sensing data for data collection, and machine learning for improved modeling,.
