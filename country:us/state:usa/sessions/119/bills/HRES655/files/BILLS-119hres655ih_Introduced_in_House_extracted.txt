IV119th CONGRESS1st SessionH. RES. 655IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESAugust 15, 2025Ms. Clarke of New York submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Oversight and Government ReformRESOLUTIONExpressing support for the designation of August 17, 2025, as Marcus Garvey Recognition Day. 
Whereas Marcus Garvey was the father of the largest African-American movement of all time, a movement which attracted millions of followers from around the world; Whereas Marcus Garvey’s legacy is deeply rooted in many North American and Caribbean communities, and his memory is highly regarded by many in the United States and his native Jamaica; 

 Whereas Marcus Garvey was able to enlist the support of more than 1,500,000 members of the Universal Negro Improvement Association to purchase shares in the Black Star Line, a cargo shipping line developed to increase the economic independence of African Americans;
     
Whereas the ultimate goal of Garvey’s philosophy was for the Black community to achieve economic independence through free enterprise, entrepreneurship, and political self-help; and  Whereas Marcus Mosiah Garvey was granted a Presidential posthumous pardon in 2025, and it is therefore fitting and appropriate at this time to recognize his contributions to Black history: Now, therefore, be it
         
That the House of Representatives supports the designation of Marcus Garvey Recognition Day and the President issuing a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
