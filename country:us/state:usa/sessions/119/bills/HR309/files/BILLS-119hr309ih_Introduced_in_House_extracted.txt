Section 1:
1.Short title This Act may be cited as the National Law Enforcement Officers Remembrance, Support and Community Outreach Act.

Section 2:
2.Findings The Congress finds the following:(1)The National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial and the National Law Enforcement Museum in Washington, DC represent the only law enforcement campus in the United States and serves a critical national mission of honoring and remembering those law enforcement officers who have died in the line of duty, educating the public about the important role of law enforcement in a democratic society and working to reduce the number of line of duty deaths and injuries among law enforcement.(2)It is in the national interest to ensure that the unique education and outreach programs of the National Law Enforcement Museum be maintained and enhanced.(3)In 1984, Congress passed and President Ronald Reagan signed into law a joint resolution to authorize the Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, Inc., to establish a National Law Enforcement Heroes Memorial (Public Law 98–534) in Washington, DC.(4)Dedicated on October 15, 1991, the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial honors Federal, tribal, State, and local law enforcement officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice for the safety and protection of our Nation and its people. The National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial is centered in the 400 block of E Street, NW, Washington, DC and is the nation’s monument to law enforcement officers who have died in the line of duty. The Memorial was built entirely with private funds.(5)In 2000, Congress passed and President William J. Clinton signed into law the National Law Enforcement Museum Act (Public Law 106–492), which authorized the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, Inc. to build and operate the National Law Enforcement Museum on Federal land in the District of Columbia to honor and commemorate the service and sacrifice of law enforcement officers in the United States.(6)In April 2016, construction began on the National Law Enforcement Museum in the District of Columbia across the street from the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Judiciary Square. In October of 2018 the National Law Enforcement Museum was completed and formally opened. No Federal funds were used to build the Museum.(7)The National Law Enforcement Museum’s mission is—(A)to honor and commemorate the extraordinary service and sacrifice of America’s law enforcement officers;(B)to serve as an important bridge between law enforcement’s past and present, between the heroes of yesteryear and those who have followed in their footsteps, and between America’s peace officers and the public they serve; and(C)to increase public understanding and support for law enforcement and to promote law enforcement safety.(8)The programs of the National Law Enforcement Museum play a critical role in educating the public about the vital importance of law enforcement in a democratic society, the critical role law enforcement plays in protecting and serving the public, and the sacrifices law enforcement officers have made to serve in this role.(9)The community education and outreach programs, activities, and special exhibits within the National Law Enforcement Museum help bring local law enforcement agencies closer to the communities they serve, and help to foster a better understanding between law enforcement and communities.(10)The National Law Enforcement Museum’s Officer Safety and Wellness education and outreach programs and activities help provide local, State and Federal law enforcement agencies with critical information on best practices to reduce the number of line of duty deaths and injuries and provide communities and the public with education concerning the sacrifices made. These programs, activities, and special exhibits are vitally important at a time when annual line of duty deaths among law enforcement officers remain at an historically high level.(11)Since the establishment in 1991 of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial, and the dedication of the National Law Enforcement Museum in 2018, the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund and the National Law Enforcement Museum have worked cooperatively with local, State and Federal law enforcement agencies to properly honor the sacrifices made by law enforcement, and provide key programming to reduce the number of law enforcement fatalities and injuries, and foster better understanding between law enforcement and the communities they serve.(12)Law enforcement agencies around the country are dedicated to continuous improvement and innovation in officer and community safety, and to building trust through community-based engagement and interventions.(13)Since 2020, there has been a significant increase in the number of law enforcement officers resigning or retiring. According to the Police Executive Research Forum, over the past three years there has been an almost 24-percent increase in the number of law enforcement officers retiring, and more than 47-percent increase in the number of law enforcement officers resigning.(14)A number of law enforcement agencies across the country remain under-staffed, and many law enforcement agencies have been forced to declare personnel emergencies and require mandatory overtime.(15)The resulting deficit in confidence and support jeopardizes public safety. There is a critical need to enhance public understanding and appreciation of law enforcement, and to improve the safety and wellness of officers who serve our communities. Fostering a more informed and positive relationship between law enforcement and the public is essential for societal safety and cohesion. A sustained national effort to restore confidence and understanding in law enforcement is urgently needed.
