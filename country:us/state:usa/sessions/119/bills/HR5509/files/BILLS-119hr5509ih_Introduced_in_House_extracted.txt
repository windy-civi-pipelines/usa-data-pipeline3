713A.Required exceptions process for medication step therapy protocols
(a)In generalIn the case of a group health plan or health insurance issuer offering coverage offered in connection with such a plan that provides coverage of a prescription drug pursuant to a medication step therapy protocol, the plan or issuer shall— (1)implement a clear, prompt, and transparent process for a participant or beneficiary (or the prescribing health care provider (referred to in this section as the prescriber) on behalf of the participant or beneficiary) to request an exception to such medication step therapy protocol, pursuant to subsection (b); and
(2)where the participant or beneficiary or prescriber's request for an exception to the medication step therapy protocols satisfies the criteria and requirements of subsection (b), cover the requested drug in accordance with the terms established by the plan or coverage for patient cost-sharing rates or amounts at the beginning of the plan year. (b)Circumstances for exception approvalThe circumstances requiring an exception to a medication step therapy protocol, pursuant to a request under subsection (a), are any of the following:
(1)Any treatments otherwise required under the protocol, or treatments in the same pharmacological class or having the same mechanism of action, including treatments provided prior to the effective date of the participant's or beneficiary's coverage under the plan or coverage, have been ineffective in the treatment of the disease or condition of the participant or beneficiary, when prescribed consistent with clinical indications, clinical guidelines, or other peer-reviewed evidence, based on the prescribing health care professional’s judgement or relevant information provided by the participant or beneficiary (including the medical records of the participant or beneficiary). (2)Delay of effective treatment would lead to severe or irreversible consequences, or worsen disease progression or a comorbidity and the treatment otherwise required under the protocol is reasonably expected by the prescriber to be ineffective based upon the documented physical or mental characteristics of the participant or beneficiary and the known characteristics of such treatment.
(3)Any treatments otherwise required under the protocol are contraindicated for the participant or beneficiary or have caused, or are likely to cause, based on clinical, peer-reviewed evidence, an adverse reaction or other physical or mental harm to the participant or beneficiary. (4)Any treatment otherwise required under the protocol has prevented, will prevent, or is likely to prevent a participant or beneficiary from achieving or maintaining reasonable and safe functional ability in performing occupational responsibilities or activities of daily living (as defined in section 441.505 of title 42, Code of Federal Regulations (or successor regulations)).
(5)The participant or beneficiary is stable for his or her disease or condition on the prescription drug or drugs selected by the prescriber and has previously received approval for coverage of the relevant drug or drugs for the disease or condition by any public or private health plan. (6)Other circumstances, as determined by the Secretary.
(c)Requirement of a clear process
(1)In generalThe process required by subsection (a) shall— (A)provide the prescriber or participant or beneficiary an opportunity to present such prescriber’s clinical rationale and relevant medical information for the group health plan or health insurance issuer to evaluate such request for exception;
(B)develop and use a standard form and instructions for the request of an exception under subsection (b), available in paper and electronic forms, and allow for submission of such form by paper and electronic means; (C)provide both paper and electronic means for the submission of requests for additional information;
(D)clearly set forth all required information and the specific criteria that will be used to determine whether an exception is warranted, which may require disclosure of— (i)the medical history or other health records of the participant or beneficiary demonstrating that the participant or beneficiary seeking an exception—
(I)has tried other drugs included in the drug therapy class without success; or (II)has taken the requested drug for a clinically appropriate amount of time to establish stability, in relation to the condition being treated and prescription guidelines given by the prescribing physician; or
(ii)other clinical information that may be relevant to conducting the exception review; (E)not require the submission of any information or supporting documentation beyond what is strictly necessary (as determined by the Secretary) to determine whether a circumstance listed in subsection (b) exists;
(F)clearly outline conditions under which an exception request warrants expedited resolution from the group health plan or health insurance issuer, pursuant to subsection (d)(2); and (G)allow a representative of a participant or beneficiary, which may include a designated third-party advocate, to act on behalf of the participant or beneficiary.
(2)Availability of process informationThe group health plan or health insurance issuer shall make information regarding the process required under subsection (a) readily available in the relevant plan materials, including the summary of benefits and, if available, on the website of the group health plan or health insurance issuer. Such information shall include— (A)the requirements for requesting an exception to a medication step therapy protocol pursuant to this section; and
(B)any forms, supporting information, and contact information, as appropriate. (d)Timing for determination of exceptionThe process required under subsection (a)(1) shall provide for the disposition of requests received under such paragraph in accordance with the following:

The plan or issuer shall respond to the participant or beneficiary and, if applicable, the requesting prescriber, with a determination of exception eligibility no later than 72 hours after receipt of the additional required information. (2)In the case of a request under circumstances in which the applicable medication step therapy protocol may seriously jeopardize the life or health of the participant or beneficiary, may jeopardize the ability of the participant or beneficiary to regain maximum function, or may subject the participant or beneficiary to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without the treatment that is the subject of the request, the plan or issuer shall conduct a review of the request and respond to the participant or beneficiary and, if applicable, the requesting prescriber, with either a determination of exception eligibility or a request for additional required information strictly necessary to make a determination of whether the conditions specified in subsection (b) are met, in accordance with the following:
(A)If the plan or issuer can make a determination of exception eligibility without additional information, such determination shall be made on an expedited basis, and no later than 24 hours after receipt of such request.

(g)ClarificationThis section shall apply with respect to any group health plan or health insurance coverage offered in connection with such a plan that provides coverage of a prescription drug pursuant to a policy that meets the definition of the term medication step therapy protocol in subsection (f), regardless of whether such policy is described by such group health plan or health insurance coverage as a step therapy protocol.
