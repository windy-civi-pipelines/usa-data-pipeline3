Section 1:
1. Short title This Act may be cited as the Preventing Health Emergencies And Temperature-related Illness and Deaths Act of 2025 or the Preventing HEAT Illness and Deaths Act of 2025.

Section 2:
2. Definitions In this Act: 
 (1) Community with environmental justice concerns The term community with environmental justice concerns means a community with significant representation of communities of color, low-income communities, or Tribal and indigenous communities, that experiences, or is at risk of experiencing, higher or more adverse human health or environmental effects as compared to other communities.   (2) Extreme heat The term extreme heat means heat that substantially exceeds local climatological norms in terms of any combination of the following: 
 (A) Duration.   (B) Intensity.  
 (C) Season length.   (D) Frequency.   
 (3) Heat The term heat means any combination of the atmospheric parameters associated with modulating human thermoregulation, such as air temperature, humidity, solar exposure, and wind speed.   (4) Heat event The term heat event means an occurrence of extreme heat of 2 days or more that may have heat-health implications.  
 (5) Heat-health The term heat-health means health effects to humans from heat, during or outside of heat events, including from vulnerability and exposure, or the risk of such effects.   (6) Indian tribe The term Indian Tribe has the meaning given that term in section 4 of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 5304).  
 (7) Native hawaiian organization The term Native Hawaiian organization has the meaning given that term in section 6207 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7517).   (8) Planning The term planning means activities performed across timescales (including days, weeks, months, years, and decades) with scenario-based, probabilistic or deterministic information to identify and take actions to proactively mitigate heat-health risks from increased frequency, duration, and intensity of heat waves and increased ambient temperature.  
 (9) Preparedness The term preparedness means activities performed across timescales (including days, weeks, months, years, and decades) with decision support tools to manage risk in advance of a heat event and increased ambient temperature.   (10) Response The term response means activities performed during and after a heat event to address heat-health and other impacts and assess improvements to planning and preparedness activities.  
 (11) Urban heat island The term urban heat island means the phenomenon observed in urbanized areas in which heat is more extreme than in the surrounding exurban areas and heat is heterogeneously distributed within urbanized areas, due to factors including—  (A) low albedo and impervious surfaces;  
 (B) low vegetation coverage; and   (C) waste heat produced in urban areas.

Section 3:
3. Findings Congress makes the following findings:  (1) Extreme heat events have been the leading cause of weather-related death in the United States over the last 30 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Weather Service.  
 (2) The fourth National Climate Assessment, mandated by the Global Change Research Act of 1990 (15 U.S.C. 2921 et seq.), finds that during the next few decades, annual average temperature over the contiguous United States is projected to increase by a further 2.2°F relative to current temperatures, regardless of future scenarios. The National Climate Assessment projects that the frequency and intensity of extreme heat events will increase in the future as global temperature increases.   (3) Exposure to extreme heat can cause acute heat-related illnesses, such as heat stroke, which already result in more than 65,000 emergency room visits each year and exacerbate respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses.  
 (4) Heat poses the greatest health risks for adults older than 65 years of age, pregnant people, young children, low-income communities, urban communities, communities with low air conditioning prevalence, socially isolated individuals, people with mental or physical disabilities, people with underlying medical conditions, agricultural or other outdoor workers, workers without sufficient access to cooling, athletes, incarcerated individuals, people experiencing homelessness, and military personnel.   (5) Extreme heat is significantly associated with serious adverse pregnancy outcomes across the United States. Those adverse pregnancy outcomes disproportionately impact Black mothers.  
 (6) Heat exposure is an issue of environmental justice, as people living in low-income communities, communities of color, and Tribal nations face a number of interacting factors that render them more vulnerable to extreme heat.   (7) The impacts of heat on human health are more severe in urban areas where land surface properties create an urban heat island, particularly in neighborhoods with limited availability of or access to green spaces, shade, and tree cover, due to higher density of building structures and more vehicular traffic.  
 (8) Limited availability of tree cover and higher temperatures are correlated with low-income neighborhoods in urban areas. In Richmond, Virginia, Baltimore, Maryland, and Washington, DC, researchers found that risk of exposure to extreme heat is disproportionately distributed to communities of color in patterns associated with segregation and redlining.   (9) Researchers have found that few communities in the United States have sufficient climate and health information, guidance, and resources for heat planning, preparedness, and response.  
 (10) The risks associated with extreme heat have complex interactions and impacts, and the management of those risks requires a transdisciplinary approach.   (11) Regions, communities, and populations that face the greatest health consequences of extreme heat often may experience the lowest heat risk perceptions, have limited incentives, or have access to the fewest resources for responding to extreme heat, and as such, may be less likely to take precautions.  
 (12) Research on the impacts of extreme heat on human health and the effectiveness of solutions under varying climate, social, and other contexts is stymied by a lack of access to reliable, timely health observations and surveillance due to proprietary data rights, expense, privacy and security concerns, inconsistent reporting of health outcomes and contributory factors, poor data integration and interoperability, few incentives and little systematic coordination to address those problems, and a lack of adequate climate observation, modeling, and assessment in rural, urban, indoor, and occupational settings.   (13) Integrated climate and health research and information, when developed in a collaborative, transdisciplinary manner, can inform long- and medium-range scenario-based planning and decision making to protect communities with environmental justice concerns and other populations from extreme heat, reduce exposure to extreme heat, and address factors that increase vulnerability.  
 (14) The Federal Government has developed, and should maintain, preserve, or reinstate, various science-informed heat-health tools for communities with environmental justice concerns, workers, employers, and the public to understand heat risk and resources, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Heat and Health Tracker, the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity Climate and Health Outlook, the National Weather Service HeatRisk portal, the National Emergency Medical Services Information System Heat-related Emergency Management Service Activation Surveillance Dashboard, and the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program and Extreme Heat website.   (15) Increased heat can have cascading and compounding impacts across and among sectors including energy, food supply and quality, transportation, housing, infrastructure, hospital and healthcare delivery, and education, all of which affect health and well-being.  
 (16) Heat action plans and early warning systems can reduce heat-related morbidity and mortality by clearly identifying roles and responsibilities as well as evidence-based actions and thresholds to enhance preparedness, and by promoting behavior changes and actions taken by local governments, communities, and individuals through awareness and increased risk perception among those most vulnerable to the health impacts of heat.

(6) Indian tribe The term Indian Tribe has the meaning given that term in section 4 of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 5304).  
 (7) Native hawaiian organization The term Native Hawaiian organization has the meaning given that term in section 6207 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7517).   (8) Planning The term planning means activities performed across timescales (including days, weeks, months, years, and decades) with scenario-based, probabilistic or deterministic information to identify and take actions to proactively mitigate heat-health risks from increased frequency, duration, and intensity of heat waves and increased ambient temperature.  
 (9) Preparedness The term preparedness means activities performed across timescales (including days, weeks, months, years, and decades) with decision support tools to manage risk in advance of a heat event and increased ambient temperature.   (10) Response The term response means activities performed during and after a heat event to address heat-health and other impacts and assess improvements to planning and preparedness activities.  
 (11) Urban heat island The term urban heat island means the phenomenon observed in urbanized areas in which heat is more extreme than in the surrounding exurban areas and heat is heterogeneously distributed within urbanized areas, due to factors including—  (A) low albedo and impervious surfaces;  
 (B) low vegetation coverage; and   (C) waste heat produced in urban areas.    
 3. Findings Congress makes the following findings:  (1) Extreme heat events have been the leading cause of weather-related death in the United States over the last 30 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Weather Service.  
 (2) The fourth National Climate Assessment, mandated by the Global Change Research Act of 1990 (15 U.S.C. 2921 et seq.), finds that during the next few decades, annual average temperature over the contiguous United States is projected to increase by a further 2.2°F relative to current temperatures, regardless of future scenarios. The National Climate Assessment projects that the frequency and intensity of extreme heat events will increase in the future as global temperature increases.   (3) Exposure to extreme heat can cause acute heat-related illnesses, such as heat stroke, which already result in more than 65,000 emergency room visits each year and exacerbate respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses.  
 (4) Heat poses the greatest health risks for adults older than 65 years of age, pregnant people, young children, low-income communities, urban communities, communities with low air conditioning prevalence, socially isolated individuals, people with mental or physical disabilities, people with underlying medical conditions, agricultural or other outdoor workers, workers without sufficient access to cooling, athletes, incarcerated individuals, people experiencing homelessness, and military personnel.   (5) Extreme heat is significantly associated with serious adverse pregnancy outcomes across the United States. Those adverse pregnancy outcomes disproportionately impact Black mothers.  
 (6) Heat exposure is an issue of environmental justice, as people living in low-income communities, communities of color, and Tribal nations face a number of interacting factors that render them more vulnerable to extreme heat.   (7) The impacts of heat on human health are more severe in urban areas where land surface properties create an urban heat island, particularly in neighborhoods with limited availability of or access to green spaces, shade, and tree cover, due to higher density of building structures and more vehicular traffic.  
 (8) Limited availability of tree cover and higher temperatures are correlated with low-income neighborhoods in urban areas. In Richmond, Virginia, Baltimore, Maryland, and Washington, DC, researchers found that risk of exposure to extreme heat is disproportionately distributed to communities of color in patterns associated with segregation and redlining.   (9) Researchers have found that few communities in the United States have sufficient climate and health information, guidance, and resources for heat planning, preparedness, and response.  
 (10) The risks associated with extreme heat have complex interactions and impacts, and the management of those risks requires a transdisciplinary approach.   (11) Regions, communities, and populations that face the greatest health consequences of extreme heat often may experience the lowest heat risk perceptions, have limited incentives, or have access to the fewest resources for responding to extreme heat, and as such, may be less likely to take precautions.  
 (12) Research on the impacts of extreme heat on human health and the effectiveness of solutions under varying climate, social, and other contexts is stymied by a lack of access to reliable, timely health observations and surveillance due to proprietary data rights, expense, privacy and security concerns, inconsistent reporting of health outcomes and contributory factors, poor data integration and interoperability, few incentives and little systematic coordination to address those problems, and a lack of adequate climate observation, modeling, and assessment in rural, urban, indoor, and occupational settings.   (13) Integrated climate and health research and information, when developed in a collaborative, transdisciplinary manner, can inform long- and medium-range scenario-based planning and decision making to protect communities with environmental justice concerns and other populations from extreme heat, reduce exposure to extreme heat, and address factors that increase vulnerability.  
 (14) The Federal Government has developed, and should maintain, preserve, or reinstate, various science-informed heat-health tools for communities with environmental justice concerns, workers, employers, and the public to understand heat risk and resources, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Heat and Health Tracker, the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity Climate and Health Outlook, the National Weather Service HeatRisk portal, the National Emergency Medical Services Information System Heat-related Emergency Management Service Activation Surveillance Dashboard, and the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program and Extreme Heat website.   (15) Increased heat can have cascading and compounding impacts across and among sectors including energy, food supply and quality, transportation, housing, infrastructure, hospital and healthcare delivery, and education, all of which affect health and well-being.  
 (16) Heat action plans and early warning systems can reduce heat-related morbidity and mortality by clearly identifying roles and responsibilities as well as evidence-based actions and thresholds to enhance preparedness, and by promoting behavior changes and actions taken by local governments, communities, and individuals through awareness and increased risk perception among those most vulnerable to the health impacts of heat.    4.
