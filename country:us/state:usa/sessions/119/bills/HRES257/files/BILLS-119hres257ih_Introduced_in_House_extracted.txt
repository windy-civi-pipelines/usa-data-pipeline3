IV119th CONGRESS1st SessionH. RES. 257IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESMarch 26, 2025Ms. Velázquez (for herself, Ms. Sewell, Mrs. McBath, Mr. Johnson of Georgia, Mr. Mannion, Ms. Stansbury, Ms. Titus, and Ms. Pingree) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Education and WorkforceRESOLUTIONExpressing support for the designation of March 2025 as Music in Our Schools Month.
Whereas music has been present in every known human culture throughout history and modern times; Whereas music is one of the most important manifestations of the cultural heritage of the United States, as music embodies our national identity and illustrates our shared history;
Whereas music education helps communities share ideas and values among cultures and generations, promoting a more cooperative and inclusive citizenry; Whereas singing has existed in classrooms in the United States since before the signing of the Declaration of Independence;
Whereas, in 1838, music as its own curriculum was first adopted by public authority in the public schools of Boston, Massachusetts; Whereas the development of a musical people has been and remains dependent on a public commitment to the teaching of music in all schools;
Whereas State legislatures and educational agencies have supported music as part of the regular school curriculum; Whereas the Every Student Succeeds Act (Public Law 114–95; 129 Stat. 1802) identified music as part of a well-rounded education;
Whereas music is a means for exploring the emotional and aesthetic dimensions of the human experience; Whereas music holds intrinsic value as an art form, providing opportunity for self-expression, fellowship, and spiritual fulfillment;
Whereas research has documented that participation in school music programs promotes student engagement, leading to improved social and academic outcomes, particularly for at-risk students; Whereas research has documented that participation in school music programs also promotes cognitive, social, and emotional development, exercising skills valuable to the workforce such as motivation, attentiveness, self-discipline, teamwork, persistence, empathy, respect, and leadership; and
Whereas a disproportionate number of students without access to music education attend schools in urban or rural communities, public schools with a high percentage of students from low-income families, and public schools that are majority Black, Hispanic, or Native American: Now, therefore, be it That the House of Representatives—
(1)supports the designation of Music in Our Schools Month; and  (2)recognizes—
(A)the fundamental importance of music to the culture of the United States; (B)the long history of music as an integral part of the schools in the United States;
(C)the disparate access to high-quality music education that exists across the United States; and (D)the need to do more to support the teaching and learning of music in public schools.
