Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Disclosing Aid Spent to Ensure Relief Act of 2025 or the DISASTER Act of 2025.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following: 
(1)At a time of constrained budgets, it is fiscally prudent to understand the amount and the scope of the Federal Governmentâ€™s involvement in providing disaster-related assistance to communities in need. (2)The Federal Government does not provide a single, publicly available estimate of the amount it is spending on disaster-related assistance. 
(3)Because recovery is a long-term process, providing disaster-related assistance requires significant Federal resources to support a multi-agency, multi-year restoration of infrastructure and commerce in affected communities. (4)Understanding the expenditures of individual Federal agencies for disaster-related assistance will help better inform the congressional appropriations process, as well as presidential budget requests. 
(5)Knowledge about disaster-related expenses will illustrate opportunities for reducing these expenses through efforts to reduce vulnerabilities to future natural disasters.
