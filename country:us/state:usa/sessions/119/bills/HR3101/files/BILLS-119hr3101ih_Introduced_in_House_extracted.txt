Section 3:
3.Sense of Congress on access to legal counselIt is the sense of Congress that— (1)unlike in the criminal legal system, there is no right to government-funded legal representation for people facing the devastating consequences of detention and deportation who cannot afford a lawyer, even children are not entitled to an attorney in these complex proceedings; 
(2)as a result, most people in removal proceedings, including an estimated 80 percent of individuals held in immigration detention during deportation cases initiated in the past 20 years, are unrepresented and are forced to navigate the complexities of immigration law against trained government prosecutors alone; (3)the consequences of detention or deportation are devastating, and can include the loss of liberty, the denial of lawful immigration status or United States citizenship, loss of livelihood, separation from and inability to support family, and life-threatening danger in the country of origin; 
(4)legal representation has been proven to significantly increase the likelihood of someone being released from detention on bond and establishing a right to remain in the United States; (5)studies show that detained immigrants with attorneys are 3.5 times more likely to be granted bond and people in detention with representation are up to 10.5 times more likely to obtain relief from deportation than those without representation, controlling for other factors; 
(6)for nondetained people, 60 percent of individuals with lawyers win their cases compared to 17 percent of those without a lawyer; (7)the detention and deportation system disproportionately impacts Black immigrants and reinforces systemic racism, and ensuring that immigrants have access to a lawyer reduces the harms of the racial inequities in the immigration system; 
(8)since 2013, local and State governments have led the charge on providing public funding for deportation defense for their residents facing deportation, with over 55 local and State governments, including 10 States, funding these programs; (9)the success of local and State publicly funded deportation defense programs demonstrate the positive impact that publicly funded universal representation programs have on improving individual outcomes, keeping families and communities together, and avoiding the resulting social, economic, and public health costs of deportation; 
(10)while these local and State programs have made a significant impact, they are insufficient to meet the need for representation and the Federal Government must act to address the significant unmet need for legal defense in the Federal immigration system by passing the Fairness to Freedom Act of 2023, which establishes a universal right to federally funded representation for anyone facing deportation, regardless of the individual’s ability to pay; (11)the growth of these local and State programs and the resulting staffing recruitment challenges have also further highlighted the acute need to develop and grow a legal and social services staffing and infrastructure to address the unmet representational needs for immigrants facing deportation; 
(12)infrastructure must be built to maintain a highly skilled and sustainable legal defense workforce equipped with the tools to implement high-quality, independent legal representation regardless of the individual’s ability to pay, prior contact with the criminal legal system, or the nature or perceived strength of their legal defense; and (13)in its 2023 Report Access to Justice in Federal Administrative Proceedings, the Legal Aid Interagency Roundtable outlines the harms that unrepresented individuals face in Federal administrative proceedings, including immigration court, and their core strategy of increasing representation and assistance by lawyers and nonlawyers for people in administrative proceedings.
