While typically only a few hundred dollars per transaction, the total remittance market is estimated by the International Monetary Fund to be over $500,000,000,000 globally. These funds are so significant to the recipient countries that they can make up percentages of their Gross Domestic Product and are significant factors in the elimination of poverty and the stabilization of economies.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H3DB9C1E5C90748858D8D68E777C5DD24"><enum>(2)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">A 2016 report from Government Accountability Office found that fines on remittances did not stop the flow of remittances, but rather led to consumers using unregulated transfer methods.</text></paragraph>

In particular, drug traffickers use Chinese Money Laundering Organizations (CMLOs), which employ IVTS, among other means, to move value across borders without needing to use the U.S. financial system. While CMLOs provide money laundering services for Transnational Criminal Organizations, their primary objective is to acquire and subsequently sell United States Dollars (and other foreign currencies) using IVTS schemes to assist Chinese nationals seeking to evade the Chinese government’s currency controls. CMLOs operating in the United States increasingly need access to significant amounts of USD to satisfy the demand for IVTS services by cartels, Chinese nationals, and other customers of their services.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H62659AB7BF244D558FBB82EA0FC455CF"><enum>(6)</enum><text>To obtain dollars, CMLOs work with South American drug cartels and also anyone who needs their underground cross-border money transfer services.</text></paragraph>
