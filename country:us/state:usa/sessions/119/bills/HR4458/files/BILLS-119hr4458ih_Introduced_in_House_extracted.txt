Section 1:
1.Short titlesThis Act may be cited as the Combating PRC Overseas and Unlawful Networked Threats through Enhanced Resilience Act of 2025 or the COUNTER Act of 2025.

Section 2:
2.FindingsAccording to multiple sources, including the 2024 annual report to Congress, titled Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China and known informally as the China Military Power Report—(1)the PRC is seeking to expand its overseas logistics and basing infrastructure to allow the PLA to project and sustain military power at greater distances;(2)a global PLA logistics network could give the PRC increased capabilities to surveil or disrupt United States military operations;(3)in August 2017, the PRC officially opened the first overseas PLA military base near the commercial port of Doraleh in Djibouti;(4)in 2019, the PRC also attempted to acquire strategically important port infrastructure at Subic Bay in the Philippines, but was stopped by the Government of the United States, the Philippines, and Japan, and by private investors;(5)in April 2025, officials from the PRC and Cambodia officially inaugurated the China-Cambodia Ream Naval Base Joint Support and Training Center and celebrated the expansion of port facilities at Ream Naval Base, some of which appear to have been reserved for the use of PRC ships that have been continuously stationed at Ream Naval Base since December 2023; and(6)in addition to the base in Djibouti and the PRC's access to the port at the Ream Naval Base in Cambodia, the PRC is likely pursuing access to additional military facilities to support naval, air, and ground forces projection in many countries.

Section 3:
3.Sense of CongressWhile the executive branch has undertaken case-by-case efforts to forestall the establishment of new PRC permanent military presence in several countries, it is the sense of Congress that future efforts to counter the PRC's global basing intentions must—(1)proceed with the urgency required to address the strategic implications of the PRC’s actions;(2)reflect sufficient interagency coordination with respect to a problem that necessitates a whole-of-government approach;(3)ensure that the United States Government maintains a proactive posture rather than a reactive posture in order to maximize strategic decision space;(4)identify a comprehensive menu of actions that would be influential in shaping a partner’s decision making regarding giving the PRC military access to its sovereign territory;(5)appropriately prioritize the subject of the PRC's global basing intentions within the context of the overall United States strategic competition with the PRC;(6)consider how the PRC uses commercial and scientific cooperation as a guise for establishing access for the PLA and other PRC security forces in foreign countries;(7)factor in the potential contributions of key allies and partners to help respond to the PRC's pursuit of global basing, many of which—(A)have historic ties and influence in many of the geographic areas the PRC is targeting for potential future bases; and(B)rely on the same basic intelligence picture to form our baseline understanding of the PRC’s global intentions;(8)establish and ensure sufficient resourcing for enduring organizational structures and security and foreign assistance and cooperation efforts to effectively address the issue of PRC global basing intentions; and(9)ensure that future force posture, freedom of movement, and other interests of the United States and our allies are not jeopardized by the continued expansion of PRC bases.
