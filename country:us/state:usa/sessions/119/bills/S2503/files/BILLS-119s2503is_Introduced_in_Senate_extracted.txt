                    (7)
 the creation of an indication or other signal in the air traffic control tower at DCA and the Potomac Terminal Radar Approach Control Facility (TRACON) to communicate the status of whether the dynamic restricted area is active or inactive;
                
                
                    (8)
 the creation of methods to anticipate fixed wing aircraft taking off from DCA so to provide sufficient warning to rotorcraft and powered-lift aircraft of the imminent activation of the dynamic restricted area; and
                
                
                    (9)
 any other matters determined appropriate by the Administrator.    (c) Briefing Not later than 30 days after completing the study required by subsection (a), the Administrator shall brief the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives on the results of the study.

                    (8)
 the creation of methods to anticipate fixed wing aircraft taking off from DCA so to provide sufficient warning to rotorcraft and powered-lift aircraft of the imminent activation of the dynamic restricted area; and
                
                
                    (9)
