(11)Operational testingThe term operational testing means testing that evaluates a complete facial recognition system as it is used in the field, including measuring false positive and false negative error rates for field uses of the system on operational or operationally representative data and under the environmental conditions and technical product settings and configurations typically used, as well as assessing the variability of system use by different users. (12)Reference photo databaseThe term reference photo database means a database populated with photos of individuals that have been identified, including databases composed of driver’s licenses, passports, or other documents made or issued by or under the authority of the United States Government, a State, a political subdivision thereof, databases operated by third parties, and arrest photo databases.

(3)Affidavit requiredWith respect to use of facial recognition pursuant to paragraph (1)(D), an appropriate prosecutor shall submit an affidavit to the court identifying specific details on why they believe that an emergency situation under clause (i) exists. (d)State law preservedThe authorities provided by subsections (b) and (c) do not authorize access reference photo databases maintained by a State, or a political subdivision of a State, unless State law expressly and unambiguously authorizes an investigative or law enforcement officer to— 
(1)access driver’s license and identification document photos; and (2)use facial recognition to conduct searches of those photos.
