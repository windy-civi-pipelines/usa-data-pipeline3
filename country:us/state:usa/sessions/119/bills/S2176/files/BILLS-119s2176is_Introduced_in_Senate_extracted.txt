            Short title
 This Act may be cited as the NNSA Infrastructure Improvements Act of 2025.

Section 2:

            Definitions
 In this Act:  (1) Administration The term Administration means the National Nuclear Security Administration.
            
            
                (2)
                Appropriate congressional
                    committees

                    (B)
 that supports the global security mission of the Administration; or   (C) that supports naval spent fuel management, nuclear material testing and examination, and functional nuclear laboratory consolidation for naval nuclear propulsion.

Section 3:

            Findings
 Congress finds the following:  (1) On October 15, 2024, the Administration published the Enterprise Blueprint, a 25-year roadmap to deliver essential infrastructure on time and at scale.
            
            
                (2)
 The nuclear enterprise infrastructure of the Administration relies on specialized production facilities and science and technology infrastructure to meet nuclear deterrence needs, including—
                
                    (A)
 research and design sites, which offer specialized research, design, certification, assessment, simulation, and engineering capabilities for the nuclear stockpile, nuclear nonproliferation, and counterterrorism;
                
                
                    (B)
 technology and manufacturing sites, which provide unique production, processing, manufacturing, assembly and disassembly, integration, technology development, and staging and storage capabilities for nuclear weapons and materials;
                
                
                    (C)
 naval reactors sites, which are responsible for design and engineering of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and submarines for the Navy and management and examination of naval spent fuel; and
                
                
                    (D)
 the special experimentation site, which hosts one-of-kind subcritical testing and a broad suite of unique experimental capabilities for the nuclear deterrence mission, including the safe handling of special nuclear and other hazardous materials.
                
            
            
                (3)
 The current state of the nuclear enterprise infrastructure of the Administration reflects decades of neglect and insufficient planning, which has resulted in more than 1/2 of the facilities within the nuclear enterprise infrastructure, many of which date back to the Manhattan Project, being in poor condition.
            
            
                (4)
 The United States must recapitalize, modernize, and expand the nuclear enterprise infrastructure to provide sufficient capacity and capability to meet the requirements of nuclear modernization programs of record.
            
            
                (5)
 The roadmap outlined in the Enterprise Blueprint provides a path forward to reconfigure an aged enterprise to meet dynamic and demanding mission requirements, including—
                
                    (A)
 simultaneous design, development, and production of more than 6 modernized nuclear weapons systems; and
                
                
                    (B)
 enduring stockpile stewardship requirements to ensure the nuclear deterrent of the United States remains safe, secure, effective, and credible.
                
            
            
                (6)
 The roadmap aligns the recapitalization strategy to address targeted needs with the programs of record as of the date of the enactment of this Act, sequencing projects so that facilities are replaced before failure and capabilities are delivered at the speed of relevance.
            
            
                (7)
 To effectuate the roadmap in the Enterprise Blueprint, the Administration must continuously review infrastructure investment plans for the near-, medium-, and long-term, and provide Congress with cost estimates, projected schedules, and workforce requirements to meet nuclear deterrence needs.
