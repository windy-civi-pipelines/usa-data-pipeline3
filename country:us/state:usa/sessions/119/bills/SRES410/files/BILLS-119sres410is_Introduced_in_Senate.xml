 <text>Whereas administrations of both political parties in the United States have long affirmed that a negotiated two-state solution is the only viable path to an enduring peace in the region;</text>
        </whereas>
        <whereas>
 <text>Whereas acts of terrorism and violence by Hamas and other terrorist groups, as well as their rejection of the State of Israel as a national homeland for the Jewish people, obstruct prospects for peace and security for both Israelis and Palestinians;</text>

        </whereas>
        <whereas>
 <text>Whereas actions and policies by the Government of Israel rejecting a two-state solution, including the July 2024 vote in the Knesset declaring opposition to Palestinian statehood, intentional expansion of settlements in the West Bank, proposals of annexation, and the deepening of the occupation, further undermine prospects for peace and regional security;</text>
        </whereas>

        <whereas>
 <text>Whereas the July 29, 2025, New York Declaration led by France and Saudi Arabia along with a number of key Arab and European countries condemned the October 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas, insisted that Hamas must not govern Gaza after the war, and reaffirmed their commitment to the recognition of a Palestinian state;</text>
        </whereas>

        </whereas>
        <whereas>
 <text>Whereas failure to advance a two-state solution risks entrenching an unacceptable permanent occupation, further destabilizing the region, and undermining United States interests and values: Now, therefore, be it</text>
