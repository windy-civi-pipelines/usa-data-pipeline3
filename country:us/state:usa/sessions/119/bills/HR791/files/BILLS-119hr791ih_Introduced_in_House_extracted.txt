or(B)has engaged in circumvention techniques that render the initial order ineffective.(5)Implementation of the order(A)ReviewIn determining whether a service provider has complied with an order under this subsection, the court shall limit its review to determining whether the measures used, or actions taken or not taken by the service provider to implement such order were unreasonable or taken in bad faith to avoid complying with the order.(B)ModificationIf a service provider, in the course of implementing an order issued under this subsection, prevents a user of the service provided by the service provider from accessing a website or online service other than the foreign website or online service identified in the order, the operator of such other website or online service may file a motion with the court to modify the order so the user may access the other website or online service.(C)Temporary suspension of implementationA service provider subject to an order issued under this subsection shall not be in violation of such order if the service temporarily removes any measures put in place to prevent access to a foreign website or online service—(i)when reasonably necessary to correct or investigate whether the implementation of the order by the service provider is preventing access to a website or online service other than the foreign online website or online service identified in the order;
