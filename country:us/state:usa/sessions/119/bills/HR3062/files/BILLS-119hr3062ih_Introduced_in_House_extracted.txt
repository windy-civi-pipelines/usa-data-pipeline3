(i)the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission with respect to border-crossing facilities consisting of oil or natural gas pipelines; and (ii)the Secretary of Energy with respect to border-crossing facilities consisting of electric transmission facilities. 
(C)Additional requirement for electric transmission facilitiesIn the case of a request for a certificate of crossing for a border-crossing facility consisting of an electric transmission facility, the Secretary of Energy shall require, as a condition of issuing the certificate of crossing under subparagraph (A), that the border-crossing facility be constructed, connected, operated, or maintained consistent with all applicable policies and standards of— (i)the Electric Reliability Organization and the applicable regional entity; and 
(ii)any Regional Transmission Organization or Independent System Operator with operational or functional control over the border-crossing facility.
