 The purposes of this Act are to—  (1) assist employers with special certificates issued under section 14(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 214(c)) to transform their business and program operations to models that support people with disabilities to find and retain work in competitive integrated employment;
            
            
                (2)
 ensure people with disabilities, families of such people, State and local governments, and other stakeholders are involved in the transformations described in paragraph (1);
            
            
                (3)
 ensure people employed in programs using such special certificates transition to competitive integrated employment positions and, as needed, to integrated services that support them in their homes and in community settings;
            
            
                (4)
 identify models and processes for shifting business and program models from such special certificates to competitive integrated employment models and integrated community participation and wraparound services, and to share that information with other such special certificate holders, State and local entities, and other service providers for people with disabilities; and
            
            
                (5)
 support States and local governments as they revise and implement their Olmstead plans and local plans, respectively, in order to improve competitive integrated employment outcomes for people with disabilities through all State workforce development systems.
