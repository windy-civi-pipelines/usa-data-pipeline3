<paragraph id="H373A092F0BA94BCAA8A6E8E3F042051C"><enum>(1)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The events of August 2021 marked a significant turning point in the history of the United States engagement in Afghanistan, as the Nation underwent a process of withdrawal after over two decades of military presence.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HAA51563827494421A3A94F4A62504695"><enum>(2)</enum><text>Over the course of those 20 years, countless men and women in uniform made tremendous sacrifices to uphold the principles of democracy and freedom, while also honoring the promises made to the Afghan people to build a safer and more prosperous Nation.</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="HD05D7D819F1C4F0E91602993FB7B7C3E"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Among these exceptional individuals were the 13 individuals who participated in the Afghanistan evacuation in 2021, serving as a beacon of hope and demonstrating unwavering dedication to the ideals of America.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H7243767D209D4F16B859C6ABA188294E"><enum>(4)</enum><text>When the final withdrawal was announced, Chad Robichaux knew he needed to act. His combat interpreter, Aziz, who had saved his life on countless occasions throughout his eight deployments to Afghanistan as part of a Joint Special Operations Task Force, was now being hunted and targeted by the Taliban for helping him. Determined to save his loyal friend, Chad embarked on a mission that would bring together 13 modern-day avengers, all Special Operations veterans, and one determined woman, to drop everything and rescue Aziz and his family from Afghanistan. Without hesitation, each member of the team agreed to join the daring mission.</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="HBB168ECCBE9B4BF08799171E904A17CD"><enum>(5)</enum><text>In a matter of hours, Chad Robichaux assembled his team and made a crucial call to Sarah Verardo, the wife of a catastrophically wounded Soldier from his service in Afghanistan, who miraculously secured their way to Hamid Karzai International Airport (HKIA) in Kabul, Afghanistan. The 12-man team quickly mobilized, with Chad heading to Abu Dhabi, UAE, to establish a humanitarian center for evacuees. Meanwhile, Tim Kennedy, Kevin Roarke, Sean Gabler, and Dave Johnson headed for HKIA itself. Setting up a command center at HKIA, the team conducted non-stop rescue operations amidst Taliban-controlled territory, facing immense danger without a Quick Reaction Force (QRF). In just 10 days, their unwavering efforts led to the successful rescue of over 12,000 lives.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HCA19894659A04AAD930AAD320C613063"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Even in the face of tremendous adversity, the team’s dedication did not waver. Despite Abbey Gate being destroyed and the gates welded shut, they refused to leave. Over the next two months, they continued their humanitarian efforts remotely, leading a coalition to rescue an additional 5,000 individuals through alternate routes around the region. Their commitment and determination made a significant difference during this critical time of need.</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="H97E975EE37EE4953A7C79DE1FB4D74E1"><enum>(7)</enum><text>Chad Robichaux’s mission did not end with the evacuation from HKIA. Teaming up with Fellow Force Recon Marine and Scout Sniper, Staff Sergeant Dennis Price, he embarked on a grueling 10-day, 90-mile reconnaissance mission along the Tajikistan and Afghanistan border, swimming into Afghanistan every night past Taliban and Chinese soldiers in order to use their special operations experience to build evacuation routes for women and children still trapped in Afghanistan as Afghan Commandos attempted to move them to the Tajikistan border. Braving the treacherous terrain and encounters with foreign militaries, including Chinese, Russian, Tajikistan, and Taliban fighters, they successfully established routes that are still in use today, ensuring more people could find their way to safety.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H4223BA0F0FD14DD5A9ED9DAB96AF681F"> <enum>(8)</enum> <text>The valor and courage displayed by Chad Robichaux, Sarah Verardo, and the 12 Special Operations veterans during the Afghanistan evacuation in 2021 exemplify the very essence of America’s promises to the Afghan people throughout the 20 years of war. Their actions served as a powerful testament to the unwavering loyalty and dedication of the United States Armed Forces, reinforcing our nation’s role as a beacon of hope and justice on the global stage. Their commitment to duty and humanity will forever be etched in the Congressional Record as a shining example of American heroism.</text>
