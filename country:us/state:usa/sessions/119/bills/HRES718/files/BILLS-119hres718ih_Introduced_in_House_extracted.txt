andWhereas greater investment in the Latino community will generate more individuals eager to pursue STEM jobs and will greatly increase the domestic high-skilled workforce: Now, therefore, be itThat the House of Representatives—(1)supports the goal of increasing Latino individuals in STEM as a way to promote economic empowerment and sustainability, not only in their community, but in the overall United States economy;(2)acknowledges that, while Latino individuals have been a foundation for the United States economy, they are underrepresented in STEM fields to the detriment of these industries and the broader United States economy;(3)acknowledges that a strong commitment toward diversity and inclusion, which has been shown to improve the performance of the STEM workforce, will require greater investment in the Latino community, and this emphasis will help develop talented and capable STEM workers, reduce the Nation’s dependence on foreign workers, and secure the Nation’s future as a leader in STEM;(4)encourages increased Federal support for initiatives aimed at boosting the number of Latino students who pursue STEM education and career paths, particularly engineering;
