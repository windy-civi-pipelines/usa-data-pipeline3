Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Buffalo Soldiers Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2025.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following:(1)In 1866, Congress passed the Army Organization Act which authorized the creation of six all-Black cavalry and infantry regiments. These regiments remained active until the Army was desegregated in 1951.(2)According to legend, American Indians called the Black cavalry troops Buffalo Soldiers because of their dark, curly hair, which resembled a buffalo’s coat.(3)The African-American troops accepted the name with pride and honor, as they were aware of the buffalo’s fierce bravery and fighting spirit.(4)The original six regiments melded into the following four regiments:(A)The 9th Cavalry Regiment assembled in New Orleans, Louisiana, in August and September of 1866. They were ordered to San Antonio, Texas, in April 1867, with the mission to maintain order and to secure the road from San Antonio to El Paso.(B)The 10th Cavalry Regiment gathered in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, during the summer of 1867. In August 1867, they were ordered to Fort Riley, Kansas, with the mission of protecting the Pacific Railroad.(C)The 24th Infantry Regiment was organized in 1869, forming from the 38th and 41st Colored Infantry Regiments. They served throughout the Western United States, with the mission to protect frontier posts and secure roadways.(D)The 25th Infantry Regiment assembled at Camp William Penn, Pennsylvania, beginning in January 1864. They were assigned to numerous districts within the Department of the Gulf with the mission to maintain security.(5)Buffalo Soldiers also assisted in the protection of National Parks. They helped fight wildfires and poachers in the Yosemite and Sequoia National Parks and served as park rangers in the Sierra Nevada.(6)In the Spanish-American War, all four regiments played key roles and fought with distinction, despite facing severe discrimination from the locals.(7)At the start of World War I, the Buffalo Soldier regiments were dispatched to locations throughout the central United States and into the Pacific, offering logistics and support behind the front lines in the American Expeditionary Forces.(8)During World War II, African-American soldiers and units continued to serve proudly under the name Buffalo Soldier, including the 92nd Infantry Division, which was the only Black division that saw combat in Europe.(9)In the Korean War, Buffalo Soldier regiments fought throughout the Korean peninsula, from the defense of the Pusan Perimeter to the counteroffensives which resulted in the end of armed hostilities and the creation of the Demilitarized Zone.(10)Buffalo Soldiers had the lowest military desertion and court-martial rates of their time. In recognition of combat valor and their actions beyond the call of duty, many were awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor.(11)The Congressional Gold Medal would be an appropriate way to shed further light on the service of the Buffalo Soldiers and the instrumental role they played in instilling an approach to inclusivity within our military and the American way of life.
