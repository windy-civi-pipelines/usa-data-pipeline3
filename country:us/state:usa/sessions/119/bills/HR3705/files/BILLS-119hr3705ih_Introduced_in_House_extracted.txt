Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Fog Observations and Geographic Forecasting Act.

Section 2:
2.Project to improve forecasts of coastal marine fog (a)In generalThe Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere shall conduct a project to improve forecasts of coastal marine fog.
(b)GoalThe goal of the project required under subsection (a) is to enhance vessel safety and reduce the economic impact of coastal marine fog events, with a focus on— (1)increasing the number of marine-based observations through additional Federal platforms and commercially acquired observations in locations where impacts from marine fog and reduced visibility have major safety and economic impacts, including through the use of—
(A)buoys; (B)meteorological stations measuring visibility, temperature, dewpoint, and wind speed and direction as a stand-alone or co-located with water level sensors, such as those that are part of the physical oceanographic observation system program of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration;
(C)stationary platforms or drifting instruments; (D)vessels;
(E)unmanned systems; (F)remote sensing technologies, including rapid refresh hyperspectral satellite imagery; and
(G)advanced algorithms that extract actionable information from observational data, including early detection and regular monitoring of marine fog; (2)advancing geographic coverage, resolution, skill, and accuracy of marine fog modeling, including, when feasible, additional locations and advancements in marine channel forecast capability;
(3)improving communication of marine fog advisories by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; (4)communicating risks posed by hazardous marine fog events in a way that maximizes informed decision making by the public; and
(5)providing decision support services based on environmental information that is actionable to the recipient of a marine fog advisory. (c)Stakeholder engagementIn implementing the project required under subsection (a), the Under Secretary shall meet with public and private stakeholders regarding the planning, development, and implementation of the project.
(d)Tribal engagementThe Under Secretary shall meet with Indian tribes (as defined in section 4 of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 5304)) regarding the planning, development, and implementation of the project required under subsection (a). (e)Project planNot later than one year after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Under Secretary shall develop a plan for the project required under subsection (a) that details the specific research, development, and technology transfer activities, as well as corresponding resources and timelines, necessary to achieve the goal set forth under subsection (b).
