Section 2:
Article I: Abuse of powerJudge Paul Engelmayer, in violation of his oath of office, did knowingly and willfully use his judicial position to advance personal interests and political gain.The Constitution provides that the House of Representatives shall have the sole Power of Impeachment and that civil Officers of the United States, including Federal judges, are subject to impeachment and removal. Further, the separation of powers under the Constitution grants the President broad authority over the executive branch, including direct control and access to departments, as part of his role in ensuring the administration of laws and policies of the United States. In his conduct of the office of United States District Court Judge, in which he violated his oath to the Constitution and duty of impartiality to the people of the United States, Paul A. Engelmayer has abused the powers of his judicial authority, having engaged in actions that prioritize personal and political affiliations over the duty of impartiality owed to the public and litigants as follows:(1)Judge Engelmayer restrained President Trump and Secretary Bessent from granting access to any Department of the Treasury record, payment systems, or any other data systems maintained by the Department of the Treasury containing personally identifiable information or confidential financial information of payees; and(2)Judge Engelmayer restrained President Trump and Secretary Bessent from granting access to all political appointees, special Government employees, and Government employees detailed from another Federal agency, to any Department of the Treasury payment record, payment systems, or any other data systems maintained by the Department of the Treasury containing personally identifiable information.This conduct has resulted in apparent bias and favoritism, representing an abuse of judicial power and is detrimental to the orderly functioning of the judiciary. Using the powers of his high office, Judge Engelmayer interfered with the will of the people. In so doing, Judge Engelmayer used the powers of his position to engage in actions that overstep his judicial authority. By making a political decision outside the scope of his legal duties, he compromised the impartiality of our judicial system.  Wherefore, Judge Engelmayer is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors and should be removed from office.
