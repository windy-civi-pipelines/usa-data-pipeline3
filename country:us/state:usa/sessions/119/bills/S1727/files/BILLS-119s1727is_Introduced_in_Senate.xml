This is why the vast majority of ESOPs also sponsor a defined contribution plan, such as a qualified cash or deferred arrangement under <external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/26/401">section 401(k)</external-xref> of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, which facilitates the diversification of workers’ retirement savings.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="idba5a2b309aea452994b6606d13ad1afc"><enum>(7)</enum><text>Sections 404 and 415 of the Internal Revenue Code impose limits on benefits and contributions under qualified retirement plans. These limits impede the ability for ESOP employees to diversify their retirement savings and make their own retirement savings contributions and often require their employers to deny matching contributions they would otherwise receive.</text></paragraph></section><section commented="no" display-inline="no-display-inline" id="ide9366ae248b744e3942a6b8b03da7556"><enum>3.</enum><header>ESOP amendments</header><subsection commented="no" display-inline="no-display-inline" id="id27e46d9b2b1a4f16aa4415a6de975b28"><enum>(a)</enum><header display-inline="yes-display-inline">ERISA</header><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Subtitle B of title III of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (<external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/29/1221">29 U.S.C. 1221 et seq.</external-xref>) is amended by adding at the end the following:</text><quoted-block style="OLC" display-inline="no-display-inline" id="id294152dfff6d49249edadf98121e6153"><part id="id2fb94d78f7704beda6f4f2adda700015" style="OLC"><enum>3</enum><header>Special rules for employee stock ownership plans</header><section id="id49c8283fb4284f83aeb4bf55f0231695"><enum>3033.</enum><header>Special rules for employee stock ownership plans</header><text display-inline="no-display-inline">For purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, with respect to an employee stock ownership plan (as defined in section 407(d)(6))—</text><paragraph commented="no" display-inline="no-display-inline" id="idbae08a0114544dd0b02ac38ffe2c3a52"><enum>(1)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">for purposes of applying <external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/26/404">section 404(a)(3)(A)</external-xref> of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the contributions taken into account for purposes of clause (i) thereof shall not include—</text><subparagraph commented="no" display-inline="no-display-inline" id="id5691a163561f4bdd811496eb94e5eb0f"><enum>(A)</enum><text>contributions of employer stock;
