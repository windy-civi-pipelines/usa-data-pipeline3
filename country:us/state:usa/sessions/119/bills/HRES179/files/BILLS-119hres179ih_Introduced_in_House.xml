<whereas><text>Whereas critical minerals are essential to United States national security and economic interests;</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas global critical minerals supply chains on which many United States firms and defense needs rely are substantially controlled by foreign entities of concern (FEOC), notably including multiple commercial entities based in or aided by the People’s Republic of China (PRC);</text></whereas> 
<whereas><text>Whereas multiple PRC commercial actors are foreign entities of concern, as defined under United States law: entities owned and controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of a government of a foreign country, such as the PRC, that may engage in activity detrimental to United States interests;</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas the International Monetary Fund estimates that sub-Saharan Africa holds 30 percent of the volume of proven critical mineral reserves, and at least 20 African countries export a range of minerals and metals, including those that are deemed <quote>critical</quote> to United States national security and economic interests;</text></whereas> 
<whereas><text>Whereas critical minerals such as cobalt, lithium, and nickel are essential to a clean energy transition, consumer electronics, and the United States defense industrial base;</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas some African nations are seeking to increase investments in their critical mineral mining and processing sectors as a means of fostering greater national mineral-related value-added refining, processing, earnings, and related socioeconomic development in their countries;</text></whereas> 
<whereas><text>Whereas responsible mining—mining that is pursued in a manner that is environmentally and legally sound, socioeconomically inclusive, and well-governed—produces sustainable state revenues, local employment, technological transfer and community development;</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas poorly governed and unregulated mining frequently produces corruption, labor abuses, environmental degradation, and violent conflict;</text></whereas> 
<whereas><text>Whereas the United States-initiated Mineral Security Partnership was established in 2022 and is composed of 14 countries and the European Union committed to catalyzing public and private investment in high standard-based development of critical mineral supply chains and responsible mining practices globally;</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas, in 2022, the United States signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia to support these two countries’ commitment to develop jointly a supply chain for electric vehicle batteries;</text></whereas> 
<whereas><text>Whereas the International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that between $180 billion and $220 billion are expected to be invested in the mining of critical minerals between 2022 and 2030, but that only 10 percent of such amount are slated to be invested in Africa;</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas, in 2023, the United States was 82 percent or more net-reliant on imports from abroad for supplies of at least 29 critical minerals, including 14 rare earth elements, and substantially import-reliant on other critical minerals and other technology-essential mined commodities; and</text></whereas> 
<whereas><text>Whereas the often-substantial degree of PRC control over critical mineral supply chains, including through PRC-origin foreign entities of concern and the PRC’s imposition of licensing regimes that could potentially restrict PRC exports of selected essential critical minerals pose grave national security risks to the United States: Now, therefore, be it</text></whereas></preamble><resolution-body style="traditional" id="H3C250EC53112485DB86C48A9EA94CE5E"> <section display-inline="yes-display-inline" section-type="undesignated-section" id="H3BA77846811F499B8A23D365EE694EBF"><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Tt is the sense of the House of Representatives that—</text>
