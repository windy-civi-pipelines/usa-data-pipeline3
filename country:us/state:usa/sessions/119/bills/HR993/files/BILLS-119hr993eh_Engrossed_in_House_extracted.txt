(iii)Miniature satellites. (13)Any other information the Secretary determines relevant.
(c)CBP Innovation Team authority
(1)In generalThe Commissioner of CBP is authorized to maintain one or more CBP Innovation Teams to research and adapt commercial technologies that are new, innovative, disruptive, or otherwise emerging or advanced that may be used by CBP to enhance, or address capability gaps in, border security operations and urgent mission needs, and assess potential outcomes, including any negative consequences, of the introduction of emerging or advanced technologies with respect to which documented capability gaps in border security operations are yet to be determined. (2)Operating procedures, planning, strategic goalsThe Commissioner of CBP shall require each team maintained pursuant to paragraph (1) to establish the following:
(A)Operating procedures that include specificity regarding roles and responsibilities within each such team and with respect to Department of Homeland Security and non-Federal partners, and protocols for entering into agreements to rapidly transition such technologies to existing or new programs of record to carry out the purposes specified in subsection (a). (B)Planning and strategic goals for each such team that includes projected costs, time frames, metrics, and key performance parameters relating to the achievement of identified strategic goals, including a metric to measure the rate at which technologies described in subsection (a) are transitioned to existing or new programs of record in accordance with subparagraph (A).
(3)ReportingNot later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act and annually thereafter, the Commissioner of CBP shall submit to the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate information relating to the activities of CBP Innovation Teams, including information regarding the following: (A)Copies of operating procedures and protocols under paragraph (2)(A) and planning and strategic goals required under paragraph (2)(B).
(B)Descriptions of the technologies piloted by each such team over the immediately preceding fiscal year, including information regarding which such technologies are determined successful and an identification of documented capability gaps that are addressed. (C)Information on the status of efforts to rapidly transition technologies determined successful to existing or new programs of record.
