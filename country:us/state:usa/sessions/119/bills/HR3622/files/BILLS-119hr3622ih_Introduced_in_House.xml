As a 10 year old girl, Joan’s eyes were opened to the extreme inequality of the races when, while visiting her grandmother in rural Georgia, she came upon a dilapidated wooden shack that served as the schoolhouse for the community’s Black children and compared it to the newly constructed block and brick school for the community’s White children. She vowed then that if she ever had a chance, she would work to change this separate but unequal system.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H9A093B34D82F42C992C434EFF13DE54C"><enum>(3)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Joan graduated from Annandale High School in Northern Virginia in the spring of 1959 and began attending Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, that fall. On February 1, 1960, during her second semester at Duke, four young Black college students entered Woolworth’s five and dime store in Greensboro, North Carolina, and challenged its segregated dining policy by sitting in at the Whites-only lunch counter. That event set off a nationwide reckoning over Southern segregation practices. When students from North Carolina College visited her church to speak on their experiences challenging the established norms, they invited those present to join the fight. Joan attended that presentation and decided this was her chance to help change things and immediately began sitting in with other like-minded students at downtown Durham’s five and dime stores, leading to her first arrest. She also joined the newly formed Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and committed herself to working for racial equality through nonviolent means, eventually working alongside such Movement luminaries as John Lewis, Julian Bond, Robert Moses, Fannie Lou Hamer, and Dorie and Joyce Ladner.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H6F7BCAE9F2D84693BE6249432A4EAE65"><enum>(4)</enum><text>During the summer of 1960, Joan worked with a DC-affiliate of SNCC, the Non-Violent Action Group, to protest local segregation policies in the National Capitol Region, integrating establishments in all 3 locales, including those in her own community of Arlington, Virginia. In addition, Joan joined the staff of Senator Clair Engel of California and worked in his office on Capitol Hill until the Freedom Movement once again called for her deeper involvement.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HFA16B5CD57FC4E7D897C95FF4B451A9D"><enum>(5)</enum><text>In the spring of 1961, Joan joined the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) Freedom Rides, working to integrate interstate travel facilities throughout the South. CORE sent her by plane to New Orleans and then by train to Jackson, Mississippi, where she was arrested and placed first in local jails, where she kept a secret diary of her experiences—now considered an important historical artifact of the Freedom Rider era. After two weeks in local jails, Joan was sent to Parchman Penitentiary where she, along with other committed activists, was held on death row for challenging the established policies of segregation. Joan was held in the penitentiary for more than 60 days until she <quote>worked off</quote> her court fine and was released.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HDABB4C7FF18F4C83B717B471AC82B989"><enum>(6)</enum><text>In the fall of 1961, Joan was accepted to the Historically Black Tougaloo College on the outskirts of Jackson to further her education as well as to continue challenging the existing segregated order. She became the first full-time matriculating White student in the history of the college, garnering headlines in national newspapers and magazines for what was then regarded as <quote>reverse integration</quote>. Also, Joan, along with other Freedom Riders who decided to remain in Jackson, became part of the vanguard of the movement for civil and voting rights in the State of Mississippi. She helped form the Non-Violent Jackson Movement, which immediately began challenging segregation on city buses and in public buildings, including courtrooms. It became her mission to help the South move on from its polarized and self-defeating system of racial segregation and learn to build a more equitable social order.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H312A0599242C46DB8BEB40A17E0CADA7"><enum>(7)</enum><text>On April 6, 1963, Joan became a member of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc., a Black Greek organization. She is recognized as one of the first white members of the esteemed Sorority.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H9F7C1FE043A94F4894DFCB20CB7FA0F3"><enum>(8)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Joan also committed herself more deeply to the non-violent philosophy of protest through her reading of works by Henry David Thoreau and Mohandas Gandhi. Joan’s commitment to nonviolence was sorely tested during the May 28, 1963, Jackson Woolworth’s sit-in, which she joined after one of her classmates was knocked from his stool and brutally kicked by a violent bystander and then arrested by the police. Joan took his place at the counter and for the next two-and-a-half hours faced the ire of a gathering mob as they jeered and then punched, pulled, and assaulted the demonstrators, dousing them with ketchup and mustard, salt and sugar, and calling them all manner of racist slurs as attempted to maintain their <quote>Southern Way of Life</quote>. Joan and her colleagues held their positions at the counter and their refusal to strike back at those assaulting them won the hearts of many who saw the now-iconic photograph of the Jackson sit-in and helped turn the tide in the fight for equal treatment of all Americans.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HD1394F6ADF9640289397FD2221DC3A58"><enum>(9)</enum><text>The Jackson Woolworth’s sit-in triggered additional massive nonviolent demonstrations for civil rights within the city of Jackson in which more than 1,000 youth, including Joan, were arrested for challenging segregation. For her role in the Jackson Movement, Joan was targeted for death by the local Ku Klux Klan, as were a number of her colleagues, including NAACP leader Medgar Evers, who would, indeed, be assassinated two weeks to the day after the Woolworth’s sit in at his home in Jackson. During the summer of 1963, Joan moved back to Washington, DC, where she attended Evers’s burial at Arlington Cemetery.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H6457A95A5AC24FC5A21C843A6CC426F6"><enum>(10)</enum><text>In all, Joan participated in more than three-dozen direct action campaigns throughout the South during her college years, including those in Rock Hill, South Carolina and Baltimore, Maryland, before graduating from Tougaloo College in the spring of 1964 and moving back to her native Virginia to begin her adult life. She started her working career as a clerk for the Smithsonian Institution before transferring to join the newly forming Community Relations Service, <quote>America’s Peacemaker</quote>, first housed in the Department of Commerce and later with the Department of Justice. During this time, Joan remained active in the civil rights field, participating in the Selma to Montgomery March in 1965 and in the March Against Fear in 1966.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HB363E99958114605B1E422059E26BFAA"><enum>(11)</enum><text>Joan eventually married and left public service to start a family. Once her five boys were school-age, Joan rejoined the workforce as a teacher’s assistant in the Arlington County Public Schools, where she became known for encouraging a multi-cultural approach to learning, pulling from her many world travels and her knowledge of sociology to help immigrants appreciate their own cultures while helping them integrate into the American way of life. After more than 30 years as an educator, Joan retired and embarked on a third career as a civil rights ambassador, traveling the country talking about her experiences and encouraging others to get involved in public life to make a difference.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HB44A6E5D693F49199ECD21C4C8569CF3"><enum>(12)</enum><text>For her service in the Civil Rights Movement and as an ambassador of nonviolence, Joan has been awarded many honors, including the Heroes Against Hate Award from the Anti-Defamation League, the National Civil Rights Museum’s Freedom Award, the International Civil Rights Museum’s Trailblazer Award, the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority’s Award of Honor, and the Simeon Booker Award for Courage. In February of 2023, Joan was honored by the Virginia General Assembly and was received on the Floor of the Virginia State Senate <quote>for her inimitable role in the civil rights movement of the 1960s and her ongoing commitment to educating others about equality and social justice</quote>. In May of 2023, she was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters by her alma mater, Tougaloo College, for her service to humanity.</text></paragraph></section><section id="HEA319AD199184608BA7DF91CDDFA8F4B"><enum>3.</enum><header>Congressional gold medal</header><subsection id="H0DD1C094604B41F7BD7596445ABD0CEC"><enum>(a)</enum><header>Presentation authorization</header><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate shall make appropriate arrangements for the presentation, on behalf of the Congress, of a gold medal of appropriate design to Joan Trumpauer Mulholland, in recognition of her unique and substantial contributions to American life through her life-long commitment to social justice and equality for all citizens, exhibited both through direct action, at great personal risk, and through ongoing educational activities.</text></subsection><subsection id="HAC694E75B44D4436A1C8024E0C7EAFF4"><enum>(b)</enum><header>Design and striking</header><text>For the purposes of the award referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury (hereafter in this Act referred to as the <quote>Secretary</quote>) shall strike a gold medal with suitable emblems, devices, and inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary.</text></subsection><subsection id="H8E8225DA888542AFBF446A71A17D7F26"><enum>(c)</enum><header>Disposition of medal</header><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Following the presentation described in subsection (a), the gold medal shall be given to Joan Trumpauer Mulholland or, if unavailable, to her son, Loki Mulholland.</text></subsection></section><section id="HF155E6646B3F4A83A27F8C09D6FF64CB"><enum>4.</enum><header>Duplicate medals</header><text display-inline="no-display-inline">The Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of the gold medal struck pursuant to section 3, at a price sufficient to cover the cost thereof, including labor, materials, dies, use of machinery, and overhead expenses.</text></section><section id="HF66D58DA358F4F7A8955BBD5D460A5BC"><enum>5.</enum><header>Status of medals</header><subsection id="HAD9A27604C2D4FBFA716DF2E153A107E"><enum>(a)</enum><header>National medals</header><text>The medals struck pursuant to this Act are national medals for purposes of <external-xref legal-doc="usc-chapter" parsable-cite="usc-chapter/31/51">chapter 51</external-xref> of title 31, United States Code.</text></subsection><subsection id="H2D8D6F11F7AC44B8BD156168B5C8ECBB"><enum>(b)</enum><header>Numismatic items</header><text>For purposes of sections 5134 and 5136 of title 31, United States Code, all medals struck under this Act shall be considered to be numismatic items.</text></subsection></section><section id="H6BBE7C68008649B68EC2CEC8781CB135"><enum>6.</enum><header>Authority to use fund amounts; proceeds of sale</header><subsection id="HE9263A9E4A9C45F1AC4AA0B79EEE0B90"><enum>(a)</enum><header>Authority To use fund amounts</header><text>There is authorized to be charged against the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund such amounts as may be necessary to pay for the cost of the medals struck under this Act.</text></subsection><subsection id="H41370B6FD32D4421BD1EF2429C461D34"><enum>(b)</enum><header>Proceeds of sale</header><text>Amounts received from the sale of duplicate bronze medals authorized under section 4 shall be deposited into the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund.</text></subsection></section></legis-body></bill>
