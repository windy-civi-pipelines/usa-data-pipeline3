Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Child Rescue Act.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following:(1)The growing international trade in child sexual abuse material creates demand and incentive for the sexual assault of children throughout the United States.(2)United States law enforcement efforts to combat child sexual exploitation have the potential to help multiple distinct groups of victims, including—(A)children depicted in child sexual abuse material (CSAM) who are still being abused;(B)children and adults whose victimization as a child continues to be viewed and shared online; and(C)children who are being sexually abused or exploited by adults who could be interdicted while accessing or sharing CSAM online.(3)In 2021, law enforcement investigative systems detected more than 325,000 unique Internet Protocol addresses in the United States seen distributing child sexual abuse material across peer-to-peer file sharing networks.(4)A growing body of research, including academic studies, analysis by the United States Sentencing Commission, and findings by law enforcement polygraphers, indicates that a significant percentage of majority of individuals possessing and sharing CSAM are dual offenders who possess illegal imagery and also commit contact offenses. In 2021, the United States Sentencing Commission found that in fiscal year 2019, 48 percent of non-production child pornography offenders engaged in aggravating sexual conduct prior to, or concurrently with, their current offense. Studies including Seto et al, the Butner Redux, the OJJDP study, and Bourke et al Tactical Polygraph study have found that between 50 and 80 percent of offenders who possess CSAM are also committing contact sexual offenses against children.(5)According to a 2018 study by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), in cases involving a single victim and single offender, actively traded cases were associated with having prepubescent victims. Actively traded cases were also associated with more egregious content in terms of sexual activity, and more likely to involve familial offenders, particularly nuclear family members.(6)CyberTipline reports often lead to the rescue of children through the successful investigation of offenders who are not only exploiting children by circulating CSAM, but who are also committing contact offenses. In 2020, 21,700,000 CyberTipline reports were submitted to NCMEC and approximately 288,000 CyberTipline reports were made available to the 61 Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) units across the country.(7)United States law enforcement’s ability to detect and interdict online traffic in CSAM provides an opportunity to locate sexual predators and rescue children through victim-centric investigations.(8)With inadequate resources, United States law enforcement agencies are increasingly unable to adequately respond to this rapidly growing number of CyberTips and other investigative leads, a problem which also reduces the number of proactive undercover investigations and education activities they can conduct.(9)Investigations of these crimes are complicated by the increasing prevalence of encryption and anonymizing services available to offenders.
