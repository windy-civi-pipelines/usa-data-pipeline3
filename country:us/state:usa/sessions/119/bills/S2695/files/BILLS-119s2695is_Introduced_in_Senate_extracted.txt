Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Synthetic Biology Advancement Act of 2025.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds that—(1)the application of synthetic biology to accelerate innovation in food and agriculture is critical to—(A)the national security and economic future of the United States; and(B)the ability of the United States to feed and fuel the global economy;(2)while agriculture has experienced significant advancements in productivity and sustainability, the future of the food system relies on disruptive technologies catalyzed by synthetic biology at the intersections of soil health, plant science, animal health, and, ultimately, human health;(3)synthetic biology is a key tool to defend against terrorism and high-consequence events;(4)investments into synthetic biology will catalyze the strengths of engineering, agriculture, and manufacturing to develop a resilient food and agriculture system;(5)resiliency is accomplished through advanced biotechnology and digital solutions to keep the United States at the forefront of feeding the United States and the world;(6)Congress has historically prioritized a safe and secure food supply in the United States, as evidenced by the enactment of the Securing Our Agriculture and Food Act (Public Law 115–43; 131 Stat. 884); and(7)innovation and research are necessary to push the boundaries of science to develop disruptive technologies that advance national security through food security.
