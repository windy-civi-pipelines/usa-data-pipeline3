 In any cases in which chemical or surgical mutilation of a child is shown to have occurred before the date of enactment of this Act, there is limited deference to prevailing standards of care to the extent that such standards contradict the intent of this Act and it is shown that the health care professional knew or should have known that such standards of care were in serious, scientific, and medical dispute at the time of the chemical or surgical mutilation.
            
(5)Nothing in this Act shall be construed to prohibit a health care professional or mental health professional from providing information about all available treatment options, discussing risks and benefits, or expressing professional medical opinions, so long as such actions do not constitute participation in chemical or surgical mutilation.

Section 6:
6.Statute of limitationsAn action under section 4 may be brought within 25 years from the date of the eighteenth birthday of an individual subjected to chemical or surgical mutilation as a child or within 4 years from the time the cost of a detransition treatment is incurred, whichever date is later.
