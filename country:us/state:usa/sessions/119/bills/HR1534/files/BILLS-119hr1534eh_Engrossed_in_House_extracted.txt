(f)Demonstrations 
(1)EstablishmentNot later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this section, the Secretary, in carrying out the program under subsection (b), and in collaboration with the Secretary of Transportation, the Administrator of General Services, industry partners, institutions of higher education, and National Laboratories, shall support demonstrations of advanced production of low-emissions cement, concrete, and asphalt that uses either— (A)a single technology or practice; or 
(B)a combination of multiple technologies or practices. (2)Selection requirementsIn carrying out the demonstrations under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall select eligible entities to carry out demonstration projects and to the maximum extent practicable— 
(A)encourage regional diversity among eligible entities, including participation by entities located in rural areas; (B)encourage technological diversity among eligible entities; and 
(C)ensure that specific projects selected— (i)expand on the existing technology demonstration programs of the Department; 
(ii)are based on the extent of greenhouse gas emissions reductions achieved; and (iii)prioritize leveraging matching funds from non-Federal sources. 
(3)ReportsThe Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate— (A)not less frequently than once every two years for the duration of the demonstrations under paragraph (1), a report describing the performance of such demonstrations; and 
(B)if any such demonstration is terminated, an assessment of the success of, and education provided by, the measures carried out by such demonstration. (4)TerminationThe Secretary may terminate the demonstrations under paragraph (1) if the Secretary determines that sufficient low-emissions cement, concrete, and asphalt produced through advanced production are commercially available domestically at a price comparable to the price of cement, concrete, and asphalt produced through traditional methods of production. 
(g)Technical assistance program 
(1)In generalThe Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation, the Secretary of Commerce (acting through the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology), the Administrator of General Services, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and appropriate representatives of relevant standards development organizations, shall provide technical assistance to eligible entities to carry out an activity described in paragraph (2) to promote the commercial application of technologies for the production and use of low-emissions cement, concrete, and asphalt. (2)Activities describedAn activity referred to in paragraph (1) is any of the following: 
(A)Efforts related to collecting data that could be used in the updating of local codes, specifications, and standards to engineering performance-based standards. (B)A lifecycle assessment of the final product. 
(C)An environmental impact comparison between different cements, concretes, and asphalts. (D)A techno-economic assessment. 
(E)An environmental permitting or other regulatory process. (F)An evaluation or testing activity. 
(G)Any other activity that promotes the commercial application of technologies developed through the program under subsection (b). (3)ApplicationsThe Secretary shall seek applications for technical assistance under this subsection— 
(A)on a competitive basis; and (B)on a periodic basis, but not less frequently than once every 12 months. 
(4)Regional centersThe Secretary may designate or establish one or more regional centers to provide technical assistance to eligible entities to carry out the activity described in paragraph (2)(A). (h)Additional coordination (1)Manufacturing USAIn carrying out this section the Secretary shall consider the following: 
(A)Leveraging the resources of relevant existing Manufacturing USA Institutes described in section 34(d) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act (15 U.S.C. 278s(d)). (B)Integrating program activities into a relevant existing Manufacturing USA Institute. 
(C)Awarding financial assistance, consistent with section 34(e) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act (15 U.S.C. 278s(e)), to a person or group of persons to assist the person or group of persons in planning, establishing, or supporting a Manufacturing U.S.A. Institute focused on advanced production of low-emissions cement, concrete, and asphalt. (2)Other Federal agenciesIn carrying out this section, the Secretary shall coordinate with other Federal agencies, including the Department of Defense, the Department of Transportation, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology, that are carrying out research and development initiatives to increase industrial competitiveness and achieve measurable greenhouse gas or directly related copollutant emissions reductions through the advanced production of cement, concrete, and asphalt.
