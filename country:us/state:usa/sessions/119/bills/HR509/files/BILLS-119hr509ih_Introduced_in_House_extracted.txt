Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following: 
(1)Our neighbors in the Western Hemisphere play a vital role in ensuring peace, security, and democracy. (2)Instability and lack of economic opportunities in the region are major drivers of migration in violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act. 
(3)According to the United States Census Bureau, in 2021 the United States exported $174.62 billion worth of goods to Central and South America, and imported $121 billion. (4)The United States is a net exporter with Central and South America. 
(5)Economic growth and development of the Western Hemisphere brings essential strength and stability to the region. (6)There is significant opportunity to expand the free flow of goods and services in the Western Hemisphere. 
(7)Closer relations among the Americas through free trade agreements and trade liberalization would encourage further economic development and stability in the region. (8)The United States should exercise its influence to encourage privatization, free markets, and economic cooperation in the region. 
(9)Countries in the region should combat corruption, strengthen the rule of law, reduce bureaucratic red tape, streamline permitting, and embrace free market principles to encourage further private sector investment. (10)With cooperation from the United States, regional countries must take serious steps to curb migration in violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act.  
(11)The Western Hemisphere has supply chains that are vulnerable due to their over dependence on the People’s Republic of China.
