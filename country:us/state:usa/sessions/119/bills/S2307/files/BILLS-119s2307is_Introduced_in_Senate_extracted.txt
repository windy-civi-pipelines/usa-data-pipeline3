The surveys shall be conducted only for those properties for which the airport has identified a property owner who is interested in having a survey be undertaken to assess the current effectiveness of the sound insulation treatment. Such surveys shall be carried out to identify any properties described in the preceding sentence that are eligible for funds under this subsection..
