 <text>In 1951, Henrietta Lacks sought treatment for her continuous vaginal bleeding from The Johns Hopkins Hospital, which was one of the few hospitals willing to treat African Americans at that time. Gynecologists discovered a large, malignant tumor on her cervix.</text>

 <text>Unbeknownst to Henrietta Lacks or her family, medical researchers took samples of Henrietta Lacks’ tumor during her treatment without her consent. Henrietta Lacks’ cells, now known as <quote>HeLa Cells</quote>, doubled every 20 to 24 hours whereas other human cells died in the same time period. The HeLa Cells are the first known immortal line of human cells in history.</text>

 <text>Henrietta Lacks’ prolific cells continue to replicate to this day and contribute to remarkable advances in medicine, including the development of the polio vaccine and drugs used to treat cancer, HIV/AIDS, hemophilia, leukemia, and Parkinson’s disease. HeLa cells have been used in research that has contributed to our understanding of the effects of radiation and zero gravity on human cells, and have informed research on chromosomal conditions, cancer, gene mapping, and precision medicine.</text>

 <text>The use of HeLa cells as the foundation for biomedical research has led to several Nobel Prize winning discoveries. The National Institute of Health located over 110,000 publications that cited the use of HeLa cells between 1953 to 2018. These advances were made possible by Henrietta Lacks’ cells, yet the revenues they generated were not known to her family for more than twenty years.</text>
