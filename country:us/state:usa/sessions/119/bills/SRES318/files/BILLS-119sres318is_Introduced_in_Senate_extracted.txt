Section 1:
That it is the sense of the Senate that—  (1) the Department of Health and Human Services should use all practicable means and measures to increase the health sector’s climate readiness and response, including increasing the ability to withstand and maintain operations during extreme weather events, strengthening the climate resilience of health infrastructure and supply chains, and lowering the sector’s environmental impact;
            
            
                (2)

        119th CONGRESS
        1st Session
        S. RES. 318
        IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
        
            July 10, 2025
            Mr. Markey (for himself, Ms. Blunt Rochester, Mr.
                    Merkley, Mr. Van Hollen, and
                    Mr. Booker) submitted the following
                resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and
                Pensions
        
        RESOLUTION
        Recognizing that climate change poses a growing threat to
            public health and necessitates coordinated action to mitigate its impacts and safeguard
            the health and well-being of all people in the United States.
    
    
        
 Whereas climate change is the most significant threat to human health in the 21st century, as affirmed by a broad scientific consensus, including more than 200 medical journals;
        
        
 Whereas climate change is driving illness, injury, displacement, and death across the United States, including—
            
                (1)
 by worsening respiratory and allergy-related illnesses and contributing to an increase in cancer risks through climate change fueled-increases in air pollution, longer pollen seasons, and increased exposure to wildfire smoke, ground-level ozone, and fine particulate matter that threaten the health of over 150,000,000 people in the United States living in areas with unhealthy air;
            
            
                (2)
 by increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease, heart attacks, and strokes, often worsened by extreme heat waves;
            
            
                (3)
 by increasing direct and indirect behavioral and mental health complications, including pre-disaster anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, substance use disorder, domestic violence, and suicidality, linked to climate-driven disasters with children, pregnant individuals, people living in high-risk zones, communities of color, and low-income communities bearing the brunt of long-term psychological and emotional harm;
            
            
                (4)
 by disproportionately increasing the rates of homelessness and displacement among infants and young children, who face the highest risk of homelessness from climate disasters when living in substandard housing or high-risk zones;
            
            
                (5)
 by increasing the prevalence of food-, insect-, and water-borne diseases, as climate change expands the range and seasonality of vectors, while flooding and warming accelerate microbial contamination of food and drinking water;
            
            
                (6)
 by increasing water-borne pathogens, which already cause over 7,000,000 illnesses, 118,000 hospitalizations, and 6,600 deaths annually in the United States, a burden that is expected to rise as climate-driven extreme weather and warming destabilize water and sanitation systems;
            
            
                (7)
 by heightening the risk of pregnancy-related complications, including still birth and preterm birth, which studies show can increase by 1 to 2 percent for each additional day of extreme heat exposure and mounting death and disability resulting from extreme weather events that continue to displace and endanger millions of people in the United States annually; and
            
            
                (8)
 by increasing the prevalence of extreme weather events, which cause death and injuries and displace and endanger millions of people in the United States annually;
            
        
        
 Whereas people with disabilities are 2 to 4 times more likely to die or be injured during climate-related disasters, including heatwaves, hurricanes, and floods, due to evacuation barriers, medical equipment failures, and lack of accessible emergency infrastructure;
        
        
 Whereas historically underserved communities, including post-industrial regions, rural areas, Tribal nations, low-income and working-class neighborhoods, communities of color, and people with disabilities and pre-existing comorbidities, face disproportionate health risks from climate hazards, such as extreme heat, severe storms, drought, and air and water pollution, often due to decades of systemic underinvestment and environmental injustice;
        
        
 Whereas workers, including those in agriculture, construction, delivery, manufacturing, and warehouse settings, face growing health and safety risks from climate change-related hazards, such as extreme heat, poor air quality, and extreme weather, and require stronger protections, standards, and workplace rights to safeguard their well-being;
        
        
 Whereas climate change costs the United States economy billions of dollars a year through its wide-ranging harms, including property damage, lost labor productivity, and increased rates of climate-related illness and mental health issues that strain the health care system of the United States;
        
        
 Whereas, in 2024 alone, the United States experienced 27 separate billion-dollar climate disasters, each compounding both financial and public health burdens on the people of the United States;
        
        
 Whereas resilient health care organizations that are equipped to remain operational during disasters are essential to their communities’ health, safety, recovery, and well-being;
        
        
 Whereas the health care sector is responsible for approximately 8.5 percent of carbon emissions in the United States, exacerbating the climate crisis and health-related emergencies;
        
        
 Whereas many emergency preparedness investments, such as improving energy efficiency, upgrading infrastructure, and installing onsite renewable energy and battery storage systems, bring health and sustainability benefits and yield significant operational savings for health care organizations;
        
        
 Whereas health care organizations, providers, and frontline health workers require sustained Federal support, clear climate adaptation guidance that addresses both physical infrastructure and psychological resilience, and reliable, consistently accessible, and locally relevant data in order to assess local climate risks, identify strengths, resources, support networks, and other key protective factors, prepare for and respond to climate change-related health threats, equitably serve at-risk populations and patients, and expand access and protections for temporarily and permanently displaced populations following a disaster;
        
        
 Whereas frontline health care workers and providers, particularly those in underserved and resource-limited settings, face increased physical, mental, and psychosocial health risks from climate change-related events, including extreme heat, poor air quality, infectious disease outbreaks, and disaster response demands, and must be equipped with the training, protections, and support necessary to continue delivering safe and equitable care; and
        
        
 Whereas delivering such support and guidance requires collaboration and coordination across the public health, data infrastructure, health insurance, quality improvement, workforce development, environmental health, and emergency preparedness and response functions across the Department of Health and Human Services and relevant Federal agencies: Now, therefore, be it
        
    
    
        
 That it is the sense of the Senate that—  (1) the Department of Health and Human Services should use all practicable means and measures to increase the health sector’s climate readiness and response, including increasing the ability to withstand and maintain operations during extreme weather events, strengthening the climate resilience of health infrastructure and supply chains, and lowering the sector’s environmental impact;
