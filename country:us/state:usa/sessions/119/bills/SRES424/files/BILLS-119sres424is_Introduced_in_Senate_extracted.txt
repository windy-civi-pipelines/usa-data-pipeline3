Johnson, 491 U.S. 397 (1989),If there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable.;Whereas the Supreme Court has held that government restrictions on viewpoint are presumptively unconstitutional;Whereas, in National Rifle Association of America v. Vullo, 602 U.S. 175 (2024), the Supreme Court unanimously held that government officials cannot use their regulatory powers to coerce individuals or entities into refraining from protected speech;Whereas, in the United States, the right to free speech is not conditioned on speech aligned with the Federal Government’s views;Whereas section 326 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 326) prohibits the Federal Communications Commission from engaging in censorship, providing that, Nothing in this chapter shall be understood or construed to give the [Federal Communications] Commission the power of censorship … no regulation or condition shall be promulgated … which shall interfere with the right of free speech.; Whereas, in 2020, the Commission issued Free Press Emergency Petition for Inquiry Into Broadcast of False Information on COVID–19, Letter Order, 35 FCC Rcd. 3032, 3033 (MB & OGC 2020), in which it stated, “the Commission does not—and cannot and will not—act as a self-appointed, free-roving arbiter of truth in journalism”;Whereas, on February 22, 2021, the Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr stated, “A newsroom’s decision about what stories to cover and how to frame them should be beyond the reach of any government official, not targeted by them.”;Whereas, on December 30, 2023, Chairman Carr posted on X, “Free speech is the counterweight—it is the check on government control. That is why censorship is the authoritarian’s dream.”; andWhereas President Donald J.
