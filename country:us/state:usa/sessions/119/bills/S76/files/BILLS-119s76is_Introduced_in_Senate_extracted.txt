or (II)for any other reason, the conduct of an assessment would be impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest; and (D)extend the deadline specified by an agency for an assessment of a major rule under paragraph (1)(B)(iv) or paragraph (2)(C) for a period of not more than 90 days if the agency justifies why the agency is unable to complete the assessment by that deadline.(5)Rule of constructionNothing in this subsection may be construed to affect—(A)the authority of an agency to assess or modify a major rule of the agency earlier than the end of the time frame specified for the major rule under paragraph (1)(B)(iv); or(B)any other provision of law that requires an agency to conduct retrospective reviews of rules issued by the agency.(6)Applicability(A)In generalThis subsection shall not apply to—(i)a major rule of an agency—(I)that the Administrator reviewed before the date of enactment of this subsection;(II)for which the agency is required to conduct a retrospective review under—(aa)section 2222 of the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996 (12 U.S.C. 3311);(bb)section 170(d) of the Financial Stability Act of 2010 (12 U.S.C. 5370(d));
