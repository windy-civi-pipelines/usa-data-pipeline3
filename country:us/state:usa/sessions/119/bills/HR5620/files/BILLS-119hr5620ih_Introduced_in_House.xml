<paragraph id="H03BB0FC78CBC4C64AD666974C3DEEEBF"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Dispute settlement is available through trade agreements with 165 other countries and there are protectionist trade barriers to United States agricultural exports in many of these countries.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H942EF05B214F45E3B2AF42C9A2F5F1E2"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Many of these barriers are systemically important. For example, India’s unrestrained use of price support programs violates its commitments under the World Trade Organization (WTO).</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="H8D9067A6428D4182B6A40FAFD17A4922"><enum>(7)</enum><text>India recognizes that its price support programs violate its WTO commitments, so instead of reforming its programs, it has repeatedly demanded a permanent exemption from disputes for these programs. Moreover, India has tried to prevent discussions at the WTO of any other significant agricultural trade issue unless it receives such a permanent exemption.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H2318508BF72243548C638542C66D5142"><enum>(8)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The Government of India has repeatedly raised its minimum price supports, which has had negative effects on several commodity markets and most notably has led to its dominance of the global rice trade, with a 40-percent share of the global market since marketing year 2020 through 2021. India is also the world's largest producer of pulses and second largest producer of wheat, peanuts, and cotton.</text></paragraph>

                <enum>(9)</enum>
 <text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The United States Trade Representative has submitted several counter notifications at the World Trade Organization showing that price supports provided by the Government of India are well beyond the World Trade Organization limit for India of 10 percent of the value of production. For example, the latest counter notification for rice shows support at 87.9 percent in marketing year 2022 through 2023 and for wheat at 67.5 percent for the same period. Other commodities also received support levels well beyond 10 percent commitment limits in previous counter notifications, including 67.9 percent for cotton, 31.7 percent for chickpeas, 41 percent for lentils, and 47.4 percent for pulses.</text>

The enacted reforms would not have changed the policies that violate WTO commitments but would have merely provided farmers with opportunities to sell their products outside of the government-run <quote>mandi</quote> system, but those were ultimately repealed.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H9144221CEEC64AACAFFEBB3D1820AD1E"><enum>(11)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Dispute settlement is an effective way to provide a neutral assessment of compliance with trade agreement terms and provide the United States a legal framework for enforcement mechanisms to facilitate fair and reciprocal trade.</text></paragraph>
