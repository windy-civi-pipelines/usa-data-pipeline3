106.Sense of Congress regarding the importance of teachers in inspiring civic engagement(a)FindingsCongress finds the following:(1)Parents have a critical voice in ensuring their children receive an education that will help them to be engaged and productive members of American society, and members of the teaching profession are crucial to helping them achieve that goal.(2)The United States suffers from a lack of consistently effective civic education that imparts knowledge about government, democratic engagement, and the Constitution.(3)Recent polling by the Annenberg Public Policy Center revealed that 22 percent of American adults are unable to name any of the three branches of government and 37 percent are unable to name or do not know any of the rights guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution.(4)Every State, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and any other territory or possession of the United States reported a lack of qualified teachers in at least one academic subject during the 2017–2018 school year.(5)The Learning Policy Institute reported a teacher shortage of about 64,000 teachers during the 2015–2016 academic year and estimated that, beginning in 2020, 300,000 new teachers will be needed each year.(6)Teachers often do not receive full support for classroom activities or for advancing their contributions to the education system through career development.(7)A survey by the Department of Education found that 94 percent of public school teachers in the United States paid for their own classroom supplies and materials without reimbursement during the 2014–2015 school year, with the average teacher spending $479 out-of-pocket.(8)Eighteen percent of teachers work a second job during the school year, making teachers three times as likely as all workers in the United States to work multiple jobs.(9)Teachers in all subjects and at all grade levels play a crucial role in educating youth about service options and the ways youth can engage in their communities.(10)The advancement of civic education and the availability of well-trained and effective teachers are essential for the future health of civil society in the United States.(b)Sense of congressIt is the sense of Congress that—(1)teachers of all subjects and at all grade levels, including those in public, private, and homeschool settings, are essential in inspiring civic knowledge and engagement in their students;(2)public school teachers are dedicated public servants and should be honored and supported in their work to educate youth in the United States;(3)teachers are crucial in inspiring their students to contribute to their Nation and communities through all forms of service;(4)the profession of teaching is a noble endeavor and one that is vital to the civic education of American youth;(5)teachers across the country have sought to raise awareness of a crisis in resource support and adequate compensation for teachers, especially at public schools;(6)officials at all levels of government should seek to address these concerns by providing teachers with resource support, adequate compensation, and career development opportunities; and(7)more Americans will be called to the teaching profession when government officials at all levels demonstrate value for the essential role of teachers in our society by providing teachers with resource support, adequate compensation, and career development opportunities.

receive an education that will help them to be engaged and productive members of American society, and members of the teaching profession are crucial to helping them achieve that goal.(2)The United States suffers from a lack of consistently effective civic education that imparts knowledge about government, democratic engagement, and the Constitution.(3)Recent polling by the Annenberg Public Policy Center revealed that 22 percent of American adults are unable to name any of the three branches of government and 37 percent are unable to name or do not know any of the rights guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution.(4)Every State, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and any other territory or possession of the United States reported a lack of qualified teachers in at least one academic subject during the 2017–2018 school year.(5)The Learning Policy Institute reported a teacher shortage of about 64,000 teachers during the 2015–2016 academic year and estimated that, beginning in 2020, 300,000 new teachers will be needed each year.(6)Teachers often do not receive full support for classroom activities or for advancing their contributions to the education system through career development.(7)A survey by the Department of Education found that 94 percent of public school teachers in the United States paid for their own classroom supplies and materials without reimbursement during the 2014–2015 school year, with the average teacher spending $479 out-of-pocket.(8)Eighteen percent of teachers work a second job during the school year, making teachers three times as likely as all workers in the United States to work multiple jobs.(9)Teachers in all subjects and at all grade levels play a crucial role in educating youth about service options and the ways youth can engage in their communities.(10)The advancement of civic education and the availability of well-trained and effective teachers are essential for the future health of civil society in the United States.(b)Sense of congressIt is the sense of Congress that—(1)teachers of all subjects and at all grade levels, including those in public, private, and homeschool settings, are essential in inspiring civic knowledge and engagement in their students;(2)public school teachers are dedicated public servants and should be honored and supported in their work to educate youth in the United States;(3)teachers are crucial in inspiring their students to contribute to their Nation and communities through all forms of service;(4)the profession of teaching is a noble endeavor and one that is vital to the civic education of American youth;(5)teachers across the country have sought to raise awareness of a crisis in resource support and adequate compensation for teachers, especially at public schools;(6)officials at all levels of government should seek to address these concerns by providing teachers with resource support, adequate compensation, and career development opportunities; and(7)more Americans will be called to the teaching profession when government officials at all levels demonstrate value for the essential role of teachers in our society by providing teachers with resource support, adequate compensation, and career development opportunities.IIElevation and integration of all forms of service201.Council on Military, National, and Public

and(2)Executive agencies should conduct a holistic review of their blended workforce and develop a comprehensive plan to ensure an efficient and cost-effective blended workforce.DAdvancement of public service: students, recent graduates, and critical skills361.Federal Fellowship and Scholarship Center(a)DefinitionsIn this section:(1)CenterThe term Center means the Federal Fellowship and Scholarship Center established under subsection (b).(2)Civil serviceThe term civil service has the meaning given the term in section 2101 of title 5, United States Code.(3)Covered agencyThe term covered agency means an Executive agency or military department.(4)Critical skillsThe term critical skills means any knowledge, skills, abilities, or education that a sponsoring agency determines is necessary to meet critical workforce requirements.(5)DirectorThe term Director means the Director of the Office of Personnel Management.(6)Executive DirectorThe term Executive Director means the Executive Director of the Center appointed under subsection (c)(1).(7)FellowshipThe term fellowship means a short-term employment opportunity (other than a post-fellowship service requirement), of not more than 2 years in length, that is intended to provide the recipient with work experience with a covered agency that prepares the recipient for permanent employment with a covered agency.(8)Institution of higher educationThe term institution of higher education has the meaning given the term in section 101 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001).(9)InternThe term intern means a student enrolled in an institution of higher education who is providing voluntary services to a covered agency under section 3111(b) of title 5, United States Code.(10)ScholarshipThe term scholarship means—(A)financial support paid by a covered agency towards the cost to an individual of attendance at an institution of higher education that is authorized to participate in a Federal student aid program under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070 et seq.) in a course of study leading to a credential in a critical skill or another program that requires the individual to demonstrate an interest in or agreement to pursue a career in public service;
