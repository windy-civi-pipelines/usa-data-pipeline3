Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Faster Labor Contracts Act.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following:(1)Employees in the United States have a right to organize collectively in order to secure higher wages and other benefits, and regularly exercise that right by voting to be represented by a labor organization in their workplaces.(2)A successful vote in favor of representation by a labor organization does not immediately lead to an agreement between the parties. Often the negotiation process is difficult and protracted, taking a year or longer.(3)Research indicates that these contracting delays are increasing over time.

The employers can use those delays to sap labor organization resolve and secure more favorable terms for the employer.(5)In order for employees in the United States to fully enjoy the benefits guaranteed to them by Federal labor law, those employees must be able to promptly secure a first contract following the legal recognition or certification of a labor organization, and Federal labor law ought to facilitate this expediency.
