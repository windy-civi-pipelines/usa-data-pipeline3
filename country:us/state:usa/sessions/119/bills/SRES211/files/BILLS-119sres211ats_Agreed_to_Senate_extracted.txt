        119th CONGRESS
        1st Session
        S. RES. 211
        IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
        
            May 8, 2025
            Mr. Heinrich (for himself and Mr. Boozman) submitted the following resolution;
                which was considered and agreed to
        
        RESOLUTION
        Designating May 10, 2025, as World Migratory Bird
                Day.
    
    
        
 Whereas migratory birds are an essential part of ecosystems, providing ecological services such as pest control, pollination, and seed dispersal;
        
        
 Whereas over 350 species of birds migrate each spring through North America, connecting ecosystems, cultures, and economies;
        
        
 Whereas migratory birds face increasing threats from habitat loss, drought, invasive species, light pollution, collisions, and urban expansion;
        
        
 Whereas North America has seen a net loss of 3,000,000,000 birds in the past 50 years;
        
        
 Whereas World Migratory Bird Day is an annual global campaign dedicated to raising awareness for migratory birds and the need for international cooperation to conserve them;
        
        
 Whereas birdwatching and bird-related recreation contribute significantly to the United States economy, with nearly 100,000,000 Americans participating and generating $279,000,000,000 in total economic output;
        
        
 Whereas the 2025 theme of World Migratory Bird Day, Shared Spaces: Creating Bird-Friendly Cities and Communities, highlights the importance of thoughtful city planning and adopting bird-friendly practices for the well-being of migratory birds;
        
        
 Whereas public education and community engagement are central to bird conservation efforts, with wildlife refuges, parks, zoos, aquariums, and community organizations hosting World Migratory Bird Day events across the United States each year;
        
        
 Whereas the North American Wetlands Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. 4401 et seq.) has promoted significant investments in wetland habitat conservation and restoration, which serve migratory birds; and
        
        
 Whereas the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 (16 U.S.C. 703 et seq.) remains a cornerstone of United States bird conservation policy, reflecting a century-long commitment to protecting migratory bird species: Now, therefore, be it
        
    
    
        
 That the Senate—  (1) designates May 10, 2025, as World Migratory Bird Day; and
            
            
                (2)
 encourages the people of the United States to celebrate and support the conservation of migratory birds and their habitats through education, stewardship, community engagement, and bird watching.
