Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following: 
(1)In 2025, there will be more than 319,750 new cases of invasive breast cancer and nearly 43,000 breast cancer deaths in the United States. (2)In 2025, there will be about 13,360 new cases of invasive cervical cancer and about 4,320 deaths from cervical cancer. 
(3)Since its creation in 1991, the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (referred to in this section as the NBCCEDP) has provided lifesaving cancer screening and diagnostic services to low-income, uninsured, or underinsured women in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, 6 territories, and 13 Tribes or Tribal organizations. (4)NBCCEDP places special emphasis on outreach to women who are geographically or culturally isolated. 
(5)NBCCEDP has served more than 6,400,000 people and provided more than 16,500,000 breast and cervical cancer screening examinations. (6)These screening exams have diagnosed nearly 80,000 invasive breast cancers and more than 25,000 premalignant breast lesions, as well as almost 5,300 invasive cervical cancers and over 248,000 premalignant cervical lesions, of which 38 percent were high-grade. 
(7)The program also provides public education, outreach, patient navigation, and care coordination to increase breast and cervical cancer screening rates. (8)Reauthorizing NBCCEDP will result in expanded services, leading to more people being screened and more cancers diagnosed at earlier stages.
