Such potential solutions shall comply with all applicable Federal regulations.

Section 3:
3.Physical alternatives to protect pedestrians and vulnerable road users
(a)StudyThe Secretary of Transportation shall carry out a study on developing physical alternatives to better protect pedestrians and vulnerable road users from traffic incidents that— (1)analyzes urban areas, as determined by the Bureau of the Census, in which pedestrian fatalities have increased in the data available as of the date of enactment of this Act to study where crashes involving pedestrians occur most frequently;
(2)examine physical alternatives to reduce vehicle crashes with vulnerable road users and fatalities, including pedestrians; and (3)studies intelligent speed assistance and blind spot detection safety systems’ impact on the safety of vulnerable road users including the ability of blind spot detection to detect all road users in a timely manner.
(b)Briefing to CongressNot later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall brief the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representative on the results of the study.

(1)innovative technology for crosswalks; (2)additional pedestrian facilities both on and off the road;
(3)expanded buffer zones; (4)pedestrian crossings;
(5)increased pedestrian accommodation on bridges; (6)upgraded highway traffic signals;
(7)accessible pedestrian signals; (8)accessible sidewalks;
(9)increased signage; (10)increased lighting at crossings;
(11)adaptive or intelligent roadway and pedestrian lighting; (12)accessible curb ramps; and
(13)marked crosswalks and grade-separated crossings. (d)ApplicationTo be eligible to receive a grant under subsection (c), an applicant shall submit to the Secretary an application at such time, in such manner, and containing such information as the Secretary may require.
(e)Authorization of appropriationsThere is authorized to be appropriated $5,000,000 for each fiscal year to carry out the grant program described under subsection (c).
