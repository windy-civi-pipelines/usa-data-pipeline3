Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Equal Health Care for All Act.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following:(1)In 1966, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhuman because it often results in physical death.. (2)Inequity in health care remains a persistent and devastating reality for many communities, and, in particular, communities of color.(3)The inequitable provision of health care has complex causes, many stemming from systemic inequality in access to health care, housing, nutrition, economic opportunity, education, and other factors.(4)Health care outcomes for Black communities in particular lag far behind those of the population as a whole.(5)A contributing factor in health disparities is explicit and implicit bias in the delivery of health care, resulting in inferior care and poorer outcomes for some patients on the basis of factors that include race, national origin, sex (including sexual orientation or gender identity), disability, age, and religion.(6)The National Academy of Medicine (formerly known as the Institute of Medicine) issued a report in 2002 titled Unequal Treatment, finding that racial and ethnic minorities receive lower-quality health care than White individuals do, even when insurance status, income, age, and severity of condition is comparable.(7)Just as Congress has sought to eliminate bias, both explicit and implicit, in employment, housing, and other parts of our society, the elimination of bias and the legacy of structural racism in health care is of paramount importance.

(2)Inequity in health care remains a persistent and devastating reality for many communities, and, in particular, communities of color.(3)The inequitable provision of health care has complex causes, many stemming from systemic inequality in access to health care, housing, nutrition, economic opportunity, education, and other factors.(4)Health care outcomes for Black communities in particular lag far behind those of the population as a whole.(5)A contributing factor in health disparities is explicit and implicit bias in the delivery of health care, resulting in inferior care and poorer outcomes for some patients on the basis of factors that include race, national origin, sex (including sexual orientation or gender identity), disability, age, and religion.(6)The National Academy of Medicine (formerly known as the Institute of Medicine) issued a report in 2002 titled Unequal Treatment, finding that racial and ethnic minorities receive lower-quality health care than White individuals do, even when insurance status, income, age, and severity of condition is comparable.(7)Just as Congress has sought to eliminate bias, both explicit and implicit, in employment, housing, and other parts of our society, the elimination of bias and the legacy of structural racism in health care is of paramount importance.3.Data collection and reporting(a)Required reporting(1)In generalThe Secretary of Health and Human Services (in this section referred to as the Secretary), in consultation with the Director for Civil Rights and Health Equity, the Director of the National Institutes of Health, the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Minority Health, and the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, shall by regulation require all health care providers and facilities that are required under other provisions of law to report data on specific health outcomes to the Department of Health and Human Services in aggregate form, to disaggregate such data by demographic characteristics, including by race, national origin, sex (including sexual orientation and gender identity), disability, and age, as well as any other factor that the Secretary determines would be useful for determining a pattern of inequitable provision of health care.(2)Proposed regulationsNot later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall issue proposed regulations to carry out paragraph (1).(b)RepositoryThe Secretary shall—(1)not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, establish a repository of the disaggregated data reported pursuant to subsection (a); and(2)ensure that such repository does not contain any data that is individually identifiable.4.Requiring equitable health care in the hospital value-based purchasing program(a)Equitable health care as value measurementSection 1886(b)(3)(B)(viii) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ww(b)(3)(B)(viii)) is amended by adding at the end the following new subclause:(XIII)(aa)Effective for payments beginning with fiscal year 2026, in expanding the number of measures under subclause (III), the Secretary shall adopt measures that relate to equitable health care furnished by hospitals in inpatient settings.(bb)In carrying out this subclause, the Secretary shall solicit input and recommendations from individuals and groups representing communities of color and other protected classes and ensure measures adopted pursuant to this subclause account for social determinants of health, as defined in section 7(e)(10) of the Equal Health Care for All Act, such that the social determinants of health do not adversely affect hospitals if any inequitable outcomes are not caused by that hospital’s provision of care.(cc)For purposes of this subclause, the term equitable health care refers to the principle that high-quality care should be provided to all individuals and health care treatment and services should not vary on account of the real or perceived race, national origin, sex (including sexual orientation and gender identity), disability, or age of an individual, as well as any other factor that the Secretary determines would be useful for determining a pattern of inequitable provision of health care..(b)Inclusion of equitable health care measuresSection 1886(o)(2)(B) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ww(o)(2)(B)) is amended by adding at the end the following new clause:(iv)Inclusion of equitable health care measuresBeginning in fiscal year 2026, measures selected under subparagraph (A) shall include the equitable health care measures described in subsection (b)(3)(B)(viii)(XIII)..5.Inequitable provision of health care as a basis for permissive exclusion from Medicare and other Federal health care programsSection 1128(b) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320a–7(b)) is amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:(18)Inequitable provision of health care(A)In generalSubject to subparagraph (B), any health care provider that the Secretary determines, under section 7(b)(2) of the Equal Health Care for All Act, has engaged in a pattern of inequitable provision of health care (as defined in subsection (e)(7) of such Act) on the basis of race, national origin, sex (including sexual orientation and gender identity), disability, or age of an individual.(B)ExceptionFor purposes of carrying out subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall not exclude any health care provider from participation in the Medicare program under title XVIII or the Medicaid program under title XIX if the exclusion of such health care provider would result in increased difficulty in access to health care services for underserved or low-income communities..6.Office for Civil Rights and Health Equity of the Department of Health and Human Services(a)Name of officeBeginning on the date of enactment of this Act, the Office for Civil Rights of the Department of Health and Human Services shall be known as the Office for Civil Rights and Health Equity of the Department of Health and Human Services.
