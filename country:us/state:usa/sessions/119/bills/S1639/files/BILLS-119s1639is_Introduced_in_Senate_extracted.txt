 At the election of the taxpayer, made in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, research or experimental expenditures which are—
                                
                                    (A)

                                    (B)
 not treated as expenses under subsection (a), and   (C) chargeable to capital account but not chargeable to property of a character which is subject to the allowance under section 167 (relating to allowance for depreciation, etc.) or section 611 (relating to allowance for depletion),

                                    treated as deferred expenses. In computing taxable income, such
                                    deferred expenses shall be allowed as a deduction ratably over
                                    such period of not less than 60 months as may be selected by the
                                    taxpayer (beginning with the month in which the taxpayer first
                                    realizes benefits from such expenditures). Such deferred
                                    expenses are expenditures properly chargeable to capital account
                                    for purposes of section 1016(a)(1) (relating to adjustments to
                                    basis of property).

 The election provided by paragraph (1) may be made for any taxable year, but only if made not later than the time prescribed by law for filing the return for such taxable year (including extensions thereof). The method so elected, and the period selected by the taxpayer, shall be adhered to in computing taxable income for the taxable year for which the election is made and for all subsequent taxable years unless, with the approval of the Secretary, a change to a different method (or to a different period) is authorized with respect to part or all of such expenditures. The election shall not apply to any expenditure paid or incurred during any taxable year before the taxable year for which the taxpayer makes the election.

                                (1)
                                In general
 At the election of the taxpayer, made in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, research or experimental expenditures which are—
                                
                                    (A)
 paid or incurred by the taxpayer in connection with his trade or business,
                                
                                
                                    (B)
 not treated as expenses under subsection (a), and   (C) chargeable to capital account but not chargeable to property of a character which is subject to the allowance under section 167 (relating to allowance for depreciation, etc.) or section 611 (relating to allowance for depletion),
                                
                                may be
                                    treated as deferred expenses. In computing taxable income, such
                                    deferred expenses shall be allowed as a deduction ratably over
                                    such period of not less than 60 months as may be selected by the
                                    taxpayer (beginning with the month in which the taxpayer first
                                    realizes benefits from such expenditures). Such deferred
                                    expenses are expenditures properly chargeable to capital account
                                    for purposes of section 1016(a)(1) (relating to adjustments to
                                    basis of property).
                            
                            
                                (2)
                                Time for and scope of election
 The election provided by paragraph (1) may be made for any taxable year, but only if made not later than the time prescribed by law for filing the return for such taxable year (including extensions thereof). The method so elected, and the period selected by the taxpayer, shall be adhered to in computing taxable income for the taxable year for which the election is made and for all subsequent taxable years unless, with the approval of the Secretary, a change to a different method (or to a different period) is authorized with respect to part or all of such expenditures. The election shall not apply to any expenditure paid or incurred during any taxable year before the taxable year for which the taxpayer makes the election.
                            
                        
                        
                            (c)
                            Land and Other Property
 This section shall not apply to any expenditure for the acquisition or improvement of land, or for the acquisition or improvement of property to be used in connection with the research or experimentation and of a character which is subject to the allowance under section 167 (relating to allowance for depreciation, etc.) or section 611 (relating to allowance for depletion); but for purposes of this section allowances under section 167, and allowances under section 611, shall be considered as expenditures.
                        
                        
                            (d)

                            (e)
                            Only Reasonable Research Expenditures Eligible
