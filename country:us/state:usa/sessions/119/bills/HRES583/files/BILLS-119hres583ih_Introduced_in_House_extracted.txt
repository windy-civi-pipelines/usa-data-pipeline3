Whereas such attacks undermine the rule of law, endanger the lives of Federal agents and local law enforcement, and disrupt critical operations essential to national security and public safety; Whereas the safety and well-being of all Federal law enforcement officers, including those serving with the U.S. Border Patrol, are paramount and must be protected; and
