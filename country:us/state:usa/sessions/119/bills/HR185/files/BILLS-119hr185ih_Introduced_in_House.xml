For purposes of this paragraph, a participant or beneficiary is culpable if the individual bears responsibility for the overpayment (such as through misrepresentations or omissions that led to the overpayment), or if the individual knew, or had good reason to know under the circumstances, that the benefit payment or payments were materially in excess of the correct amount. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, an individual is not culpable merely because the individual believed the benefit payment or payments were or might be in excess of the correct amount, if the individual raised that question with an authorized plan representative and was told the payment or payments were not in excess of the correct amount. With respect to a culpable participant or beneficiary, efforts to recoup overpayments shall not be made through threats of litigation, unless a lawyer for the plan could make the representations required under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure if the litigation were brought in Federal court.</text></paragraph></subsection><after-quoted-block>.</after-quoted-block></quoted-block></subsection> <subsection id="HAD4EFF0E88654D1E9E81F54D16C9E948"><enum>(b)</enum><header>Overpayments under internal revenue code of 1986</header> <paragraph id="HA75112AD9AD84E948D37816FF840C56A"><enum>(1)</enum><header>Qualification requirements</header><text><external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/26/414">Section 414</external-xref> of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended by this preceding provisions of this Act, is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:</text>
