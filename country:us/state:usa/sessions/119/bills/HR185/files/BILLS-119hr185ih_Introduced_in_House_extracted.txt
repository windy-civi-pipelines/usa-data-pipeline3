422.Recovery of retirement plan overpayments (a)Overpayments under ERISASection 206 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1056) is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:

(h)Special rules applicable to benefit overpayments
(1)General ruleIn the case of an inadvertent benefit overpayment by any pension plan, the responsible plan fiduciary shall not be considered to have failed to comply with the requirements of this title merely because such fiduciary determines, in the exercise of its fiduciary discretion, not to seek recovery of all or part of such overpayment from— (A)any participant or beneficiary,
(B)any plan sponsor of, or contributing employer to— (i)an individual account plan, provided that the amount needed to prevent or restore any impermissible forfeiture from any participant’s or beneficiary’s account arising in connection with the overpayment is, separately from and independently of the overpayment, allocated to such account pursuant to the nonforfeitability requirements of section 203 (for example, out of the plan’s forfeiture account, additional employer contributions, or recoveries from those responsible for the overpayment), or
(ii)a defined benefit pension plan subject to the funding rules in part 3 of this subtitle B, unless the responsible plan fiduciary determines, in the exercise of its fiduciary discretion, that failure to recover all or part of the overpayment faster than required under such funding rules would materially affect the plan’s ability to pay benefits due to other participants and beneficiaries, or (C)any fiduciary of the plan, other than a fiduciary (including a plan sponsor or contributing employer acting in a fiduciary capacity) whose breach of its fiduciary duties resulted in such overpayment, provided that if the plan has established prudent procedures to prevent and minimize overpayment of benefits and the relevant plan fiduciaries have followed such procedures, an inadvertent benefit overpayment will not give rise to a breach of fiduciary duty.
(2)Reduction in future benefit payments and recovery from responsible partyParagraph (1) shall not fail to apply with respect to any inadvertent benefit overpayment merely because, after discovering such overpayment, the responsible plan fiduciary— (A)reduces future benefit payments to the correct amount provided for under the terms of the plan, or
(B)seeks recovery from the person or persons responsible for the overpayment. (3)Employer funding obligationsNothing in this subsection shall relieve an employer of any obligation imposed on it to make contributions to a plan to meet the minimum funding standards under part 3 of this subtitle B or to prevent or restore an impermissible forfeiture in accordance with section 203.
(4)Recoupment from participants and beneficiariesIf the responsible plan fiduciary, in the exercise of its fiduciary discretion, decides to seek recoupment from a participant or beneficiary of all or part of an inadvertent benefit overpayment made by the plan to such participant or beneficiary, it may do so, subject to the following conditions: (A)No interest or other additional amounts (such as collection costs or fees) are sought on overpaid amounts for any period.
(B)If the plan seeks to recoup past overpayments of a non-decreasing periodic benefit by reducing future benefit payments— (i)the reduction ceases after the plan has recovered the full dollar amount of the overpayment,
(ii)the amount recouped each calendar year does not exceed 10 percent of the full dollar amount of the overpayment, and (iii)future benefit payments are not reduced to below 90 percent of the periodic amount otherwise payable under the terms of the plan.Alternatively, if the plan seeks to recoup past overpayments of a non-decreasing periodic benefit through one or more installment payments, the sum of such installment payments in any calendar year does not exceed the sum of the reductions that would be permitted in such year under the preceding sentence.
(C)If the plan seeks to recoup past overpayments of a benefit other than a non-decreasing periodic benefit, the plan satisfies requirements developed by the Secretary for purposes of this subparagraph. (D)Efforts to recoup overpayments are—
(i)not accompanied by threats of litigation, unless the responsible plan fiduciary reasonably believes it could prevail in a civil action brought in Federal or State court to recoup the overpayments, and (ii)not made through a collection agency or similar third party, unless the participant or beneficiary ignores or rejects efforts to recoup the overpayment following either a final judgment in Federal or State court or a settlement between the participant or beneficiary and the plan, in either case authorizing such recoupment.
(E)Recoupment of past overpayments to a participant is not sought from any beneficiary of the participant, including a spouse, surviving spouse, former spouse, or other beneficiary. (F)Recoupment may not be sought if the first overpayment occurred more than 3 years before the participant or beneficiary is first notified in writing of the error.
(G)A participant or beneficiary from whom recoupment is sought is entitled to contest all or part of the recoupment pursuant to the plan’s claims procedures. (H)In determining the amount of recoupment to seek, the responsible plan fiduciary may take into account the hardship that recoupment likely would impose on the participant or beneficiary.
(5)Effect of culpabilitySubparagraphs (A) through (F) of paragraph (4) shall not apply to protect a participant or beneficiary who is culpable. For purposes of this paragraph, a participant or beneficiary is culpable if the individual bears responsibility for the overpayment (such as through misrepresentations or omissions that led to the overpayment), or if the individual knew, or had good reason to know under the circumstances, that the benefit payment or payments were materially in excess of the correct amount. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, an individual is not culpable merely because the individual believed the benefit payment or payments were or might be in excess of the correct amount, if the individual raised that question with an authorized plan representative and was told the payment or payments were not in excess of the correct amount. With respect to a culpable participant or beneficiary, efforts to recoup overpayments shall not be made through threats of litigation, unless a lawyer for the plan could make the representations required under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure if the litigation were brought in Federal court.. (b)Overpayments under internal revenue code of 1986 (1)Qualification requirementsSection 414 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended by this preceding provisions of this Act, is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:

(bb)Special rules applicable to benefit overpayments

(B)the plan sponsor amends the plan to increase past or future benefit payments to affected participants and beneficiaries in order to adjust for prior inadvertent benefit overpayments. (2)Reduction in future benefit payments and recovery from responsible partyParagraph (1) shall not fail to apply to a plan merely because, after discovering a benefit overpayment, such plan—
(A)reduces future benefit payments to the correct amount provided for under the terms of the plan, or (B)seeks recovery from the person or persons responsible for such overpayment.
(3)Employer funding obligationsNothing in this subsection shall relieve an employer of any obligation imposed on it to make contributions to a plan to meet the minimum funding standards under sections 412 and 430 or to prevent or restore an impermissible forfeiture in accordance with section 411. (4)Observance of benefit limitationsNotwithstanding paragraph (1), a plan to which paragraph (1) applies shall observe any limitations imposed on it by section 401(a)(17) or 415. The plan may enforce such limitations using any method approved by the Secretary of the Treasury for recouping benefits previously paid or allocations previously made in excess of such limitations.
(5)Coordination with other qualification requirementsThe Secretary of the Treasury may issue regulations or other guidance of general applicability specifying how benefit overpayments and their recoupment or non-recoupment from a participant or beneficiary shall be taken into account for purposes of satisfying any requirement applicable to a plan to which paragraph (1) applies. (2)RolloversSection 402(c) of such Code is amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:

(12)In the case of an inadvertent benefit overpayment from a plan to which section 414(bb)(1) applies that is transferred to an eligible retirement plan by or on behalf of a participant or beneficiary— (A)the portion of such overpayment with respect to which recoupment is not sought on behalf of the plan shall be treated as having been paid in an eligible rollover distribution if the payment would have been an eligible rollover distribution but for being an overpayment, and
(B)the portion of such overpayment with respect to which recoupment is sought on behalf of the plan shall be permitted to be returned to such plan and in such case shall be treated as an eligible rollover distribution transferred to such plan by the participant or beneficiary who received such overpayment (and the plans making and receiving such transfer shall be treated as permitting such transfer).In any case in which recoupment is sought on behalf of the plan but is disputed by the participant or beneficiary who received such overpayment, such dispute shall be subject to the claims procedures of the plan that made such overpayment, such plan shall notify the plan receiving the rollover of such dispute, and the plan receiving the rollover shall retain such overpayment on behalf of the participant or beneficiary (and shall be entitled to treat such overpayment as plan assets) pending the outcome of such procedures.. (c)Effective dateThe amendments made by this section shall apply as of the date of the enactment of this Act.
(d)Certain actions before date of enactmentPlans, fiduciaries, employers, and plan sponsors are entitled to rely on— (1)a good faith interpretation of then existing administrative guidance for inadvertent benefit overpayment recoupments and recoveries that commenced before the date of enactment of this Act, and
(2)determinations made before the date of enactment of this Act by the responsible plan fiduciary, in the exercise of its fiduciary discretion, not to seek recoupment or recovery of all or part of an inadvertent benefit overpayment.In the case of a benefit overpayment that occurred prior to the date of enactment of this Act, any installment payments by the participant or beneficiary to the plan or any reduction in periodic benefit payments to the participant or beneficiary, which were made in recoupment of such overpayment and which commenced prior to such date, may continue after such date. Nothing in this subsection shall relieve a fiduciary from responsibility for an overpayment that resulted from a breach of its fiduciary duties.

(2)for purposes of determining the blend’s returns for 1-, 5-, and 10-calendar-year periods (or for the life of the alternative, if shorter), the blend is modified at least once per year to reflect changes in the asset class holdings of the designated investment alternative; (3)the blend is furnished to participants and beneficiaries in a manner that is reasonably designed to be understandable; and

(h)Special rules applicable to benefit overpayments
(1)General ruleIn the case of an inadvertent benefit overpayment by any pension plan, the responsible plan fiduciary shall not be considered to have failed to comply with the requirements of this title merely because such fiduciary determines, in the exercise of its fiduciary discretion, not to seek recovery of all or part of such overpayment from— (A)any participant or beneficiary,
(B)any plan sponsor of, or contributing employer to— (i)an individual account plan, provided that the amount needed to prevent or restore any impermissible forfeiture from any participant’s or beneficiary’s account arising in connection with the overpayment is, separately from and independently of the overpayment, allocated to such account pursuant to the nonforfeitability requirements of section 203 (for example, out of the plan’s forfeiture account, additional employer contributions, or recoveries from those responsible for the overpayment), or
(ii)a defined benefit pension plan subject to the funding rules in part 3 of this subtitle B, unless the responsible plan fiduciary determines, in the exercise of its fiduciary discretion, that failure to recover all or part of the overpayment faster than required under such funding rules would materially affect the plan’s ability to pay benefits due to other participants and beneficiaries, or (C)any fiduciary of the plan, other than a fiduciary (including a plan sponsor or contributing employer acting in a fiduciary capacity) whose breach of its fiduciary duties resulted in such overpayment, provided that if the plan has established prudent procedures to prevent and minimize overpayment of benefits and the relevant plan fiduciaries have followed such procedures, an inadvertent benefit overpayment will not give rise to a breach of fiduciary duty.
(2)Reduction in future benefit payments and recovery from responsible partyParagraph (1) shall not fail to apply with respect to any inadvertent benefit overpayment merely because, after discovering such overpayment, the responsible plan fiduciary— (A)reduces future benefit payments to the correct amount provided for under the terms of the plan, or
(B)seeks recovery from the person or persons responsible for the overpayment. (3)Employer funding obligationsNothing in this subsection shall relieve an employer of any obligation imposed on it to make contributions to a plan to meet the minimum funding standards under part 3 of this subtitle B or to prevent or restore an impermissible forfeiture in accordance with section 203.
(4)Recoupment from participants and beneficiariesIf the responsible plan fiduciary, in the exercise of its fiduciary discretion, decides to seek recoupment from a participant or beneficiary of all or part of an inadvertent benefit overpayment made by the plan to such participant or beneficiary, it may do so, subject to the following conditions: (A)No interest or other additional amounts (such as collection costs or fees) are sought on overpaid amounts for any period.
(B)If the plan seeks to recoup past overpayments of a non-decreasing periodic benefit by reducing future benefit payments— (i)the reduction ceases after the plan has recovered the full dollar amount of the overpayment,
(ii)the amount recouped each calendar year does not exceed 10 percent of the full dollar amount of the overpayment, and (iii)future benefit payments are not reduced to below 90 percent of the periodic amount otherwise payable under the terms of the plan.Alternatively, if the plan seeks to recoup past overpayments of a non-decreasing periodic benefit through one or more installment payments, the sum of such installment payments in any calendar year does not exceed the sum of the reductions that would be permitted in such year under the preceding sentence.
(C)If the plan seeks to recoup past overpayments of a benefit other than a non-decreasing periodic benefit, the plan satisfies requirements developed by the Secretary for purposes of this subparagraph. (D)Efforts to recoup overpayments are—
(i)not accompanied by threats of litigation, unless the responsible plan fiduciary reasonably believes it could prevail in a civil action brought in Federal or State court to recoup the overpayments, and (ii)not made through a collection agency or similar third party, unless the participant or beneficiary ignores or rejects efforts to recoup the overpayment following either a final judgment in Federal or State court or a settlement between the participant or beneficiary and the plan, in either case authorizing such recoupment.
(E)Recoupment of past overpayments to a participant is not sought from any beneficiary of the participant, including a spouse, surviving spouse, former spouse, or other beneficiary. (F)Recoupment may not be sought if the first overpayment occurred more than 3 years before the participant or beneficiary is first notified in writing of the error.
(G)A participant or beneficiary from whom recoupment is sought is entitled to contest all or part of the recoupment pursuant to the plan’s claims procedures. (H)In determining the amount of recoupment to seek, the responsible plan fiduciary may take into account the hardship that recoupment likely would impose on the participant or beneficiary.
(5)Effect of culpabilitySubparagraphs (A) through (F) of paragraph (4) shall not apply to protect a participant or beneficiary who is culpable. For purposes of this paragraph, a participant or beneficiary is culpable if the individual bears responsibility for the overpayment (such as through misrepresentations or omissions that led to the overpayment), or if the individual knew, or had good reason to know under the circumstances, that the benefit payment or payments were materially in excess of the correct amount. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, an individual is not culpable merely because the individual believed the benefit payment or payments were or might be in excess of the correct amount, if the individual raised that question with an authorized plan representative and was told the payment or payments were not in excess of the correct amount. With respect to a culpable participant or beneficiary, efforts to recoup overpayments shall not be made through threats of litigation, unless a lawyer for the plan could make the representations required under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure if the litigation were brought in Federal court.. (b)Overpayments under internal revenue code of 1986 (1)Qualification requirementsSection 414 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended by this preceding provisions of this Act, is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:

(B)the plan sponsor amends the plan to increase past or future benefit payments to affected participants and beneficiaries in order to adjust for prior inadvertent benefit overpayments. (2)Reduction in future benefit payments and recovery from responsible partyParagraph (1) shall not fail to apply to a plan merely because, after discovering a benefit overpayment, such plan—
(A)reduces future benefit payments to the correct amount provided for under the terms of the plan, or (B)seeks recovery from the person or persons responsible for such overpayment.
(3)Employer funding obligationsNothing in this subsection shall relieve an employer of any obligation imposed on it to make contributions to a plan to meet the minimum funding standards under sections 412 and 430 or to prevent or restore an impermissible forfeiture in accordance with section 411. (4)Observance of benefit limitationsNotwithstanding paragraph (1), a plan to which paragraph (1) applies shall observe any limitations imposed on it by section 401(a)(17) or 415. The plan may enforce such limitations using any method approved by the Secretary of the Treasury for recouping benefits previously paid or allocations previously made in excess of such limitations.
(5)Coordination with other qualification requirementsThe Secretary of the Treasury may issue regulations or other guidance of general applicability specifying how benefit overpayments and their recoupment or non-recoupment from a participant or beneficiary shall be taken into account for purposes of satisfying any requirement applicable to a plan to which paragraph (1) applies. (2)RolloversSection 402(c) of such Code is amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:

(12)In the case of an inadvertent benefit overpayment from a plan to which section 414(bb)(1) applies that is transferred to an eligible retirement plan by or on behalf of a participant or beneficiary— (A)the portion of such overpayment with respect to which recoupment is not sought on behalf of the plan shall be treated as having been paid in an eligible rollover distribution if the payment would have been an eligible rollover distribution but for being an overpayment, and
(B)the portion of such overpayment with respect to which recoupment is sought on behalf of the plan shall be permitted to be returned to such plan and in such case shall be treated as an eligible rollover distribution transferred to such plan by the participant or beneficiary who received such overpayment (and the plans making and receiving such transfer shall be treated as permitting such transfer).In any case in which recoupment is sought on behalf of the plan but is disputed by the participant or beneficiary who received such overpayment, such dispute shall be subject to the claims procedures of the plan that made such overpayment, such plan shall notify the plan receiving the rollover of such dispute, and the plan receiving the rollover shall retain such overpayment on behalf of the participant or beneficiary (and shall be entitled to treat such overpayment as plan assets) pending the outcome of such procedures.. (c)Effective dateThe amendments made by this section shall apply as of the date of the enactment of this Act.
(d)Certain actions before date of enactmentPlans, fiduciaries, employers, and plan sponsors are entitled to rely on— (1)a good faith interpretation of then existing administrative guidance for inadvertent benefit overpayment recoupments and recoveries that commenced before the date of enactment of this Act, and
(2)determinations made before the date of enactment of this Act by the responsible plan fiduciary, in the exercise of its fiduciary discretion, not to seek recoupment or recovery of all or part of an inadvertent benefit overpayment.In the case of a benefit overpayment that occurred prior to the date of enactment of this Act, any installment payments by the participant or beneficiary to the plan or any reduction in periodic benefit payments to the participant or beneficiary, which were made in recoupment of such overpayment and which commenced prior to such date, may continue after such date. Nothing in this subsection shall relieve a fiduciary from responsibility for an overpayment that resulted from a breach of its fiduciary duties. 423.Reduction in excise tax on certain accumulations in qualified retirement plans (a)In generalSection 4974(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by striking 50 percent and inserting 25 percent.

(2)Correction windowFor purposes of this subsection, the term correction window means the period of time beginning on the date on which the tax under subsection (a) is imposed with respect to a shortfall of distributions from an individual retirement plan, and ending on the earlier of— (A)the date on which the Secretary initiates an audit, or otherwise demands payment, with respect to the shortfall of distributions, or
(B)the last day of the second taxable year that begins after the end of the taxable year in which the tax under subsection (a) is imposed.. (c)Effective dateThe amendments made by this section shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024.
424.Performance benchmarks for asset allocation funds
(a)In generalNot later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Labor shall provide that, in the case of a designated investment alternative that contains a mix of asset classes, the administrator of a plan may, but is not required to, use a benchmark that is a blend of different broad-based securities market indices if— (1)the blend is reasonably representative of the asset class holdings of the designated investment alternative;
(2)for purposes of determining the blend’s returns for 1-, 5-, and 10-calendar-year periods (or for the life of the alternative, if shorter), the blend is modified at least once per year to reflect changes in the asset class holdings of the designated investment alternative; (3)the blend is furnished to participants and beneficiaries in a manner that is reasonably designed to be understandable; and
(4)each securities market index that is used for an associated asset class would separately satisfy the requirements of such regulation for such asset class.

(1)Semiconductors underpin the United States and global economies, including manufacturing sectors. Semiconductors are also essential to the national security of the United States. (2)A shortage of semiconductors, brought about by the COVID–19 pandemic and other complex factors impacting the overall supply chain, has threatened the economic recovery of the United States and industries that employ millions of United States citizens.
(3)Addressing current challenges and building resilience against future risks requires ensuring a secure and stable supply chain for semiconductors that will support the economic and national security needs of the United States and its allies. (4)The supply chain for semiconductors is complex and global. While the United States plays a leading role in certain segments of the semiconductor industry, securing the supply chain requires onshoring, reshoring, or diversifying vulnerable segments, such as for—
(A)fabrication; (B)advanced packaging; and
(C)materials and equipment used to manufacture semiconductor products. (5)The Federal Government can leverage foreign direct investment and private dollars to grow the domestic manufacturing and production capacity of the United States for vulnerable segments of the semiconductor supply chain.
(6)The SelectUSA program of the Department of Commerce, in coordination with other Federal agencies and State-level economic development organizations, is positioned to boost foreign direct investment in domestic manufacturing and to help secure the semiconductor supply chain of the United States. 803.Coordination with state-level economic development organizationsNot later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Executive Director of SelectUSA shall solicit comments from State-level economic development organizations—
(1)to review— (A)what efforts the Federal Government can take to support increased foreign direct investment in any segment of semiconductor-related production;
