Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510 (1925), that the State does not have power to standardize its children by forcing them to accept instruction from public teachers only. The child is not the mere creature of the state; those who nurture him and direct his destiny have the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare him for additional obligations.;Whereas religious instruction can come from a variety of sources, including sectarian schools and released time programs;Whereas, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, in 2015, 4,350,000 children in the United States attended sectarian elementary and secondary schools where those children received religious education; andWhereas the Supreme Court of the United States held in Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U.S. 306 (1952), that State statutes providing for the release of public school students from school to attend religious classes are constitutional, and, as a result, an estimated 540,000 public school students in the United States take advantage of released time programs each year: Now, therefore, be itThat the Senate—(1)affirms the importance of religious education in the civic and moral development of the people of the United States;(2)celebrates the schools and organizations that are engaged in religious instruction of the children of the United States to aid those children in intellectual, ethical, moral, and civic development;(3)calls on each of the 50 States, each territory of the United States, and the District of Columbia to accommodate individuals who wish to be released from public school attendance to attend religious classes; and(4)designates the week of October 5, 2025, through October 11, 2025, as Religious Education Week.
