<whereas><text>Whereas this resolution may be cited as the <quote><short-title>Original Resolution Honoring John Brown</short-title></quote>;</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas the United States was established on the majestic inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness as proclaimed in the Declaration of Independence;</text></whereas> 
<whereas><text>Whereas these fundamental inalienable rights, despite being declared the moral compass of our Nation, were not initially applied to all of its inhabitants;</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas this was especially evident in the early chapters of our history where slavery stood in stark contradiction to these noble ideals;</text></whereas> 
<whereas><text>Whereas, throughout history, countless courageous souls have endeavored to ensure these rights were honored for all people, irrespective of their race, ethnicity, or origins;</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas, in the face of the contradictions of the early United States, many brave patriots of different hues took it upon themselves the task of shaping the Nation toward its founding ideals;</text></whereas> 
<whereas><text>Whereas Paul Revere was the Anglo patriot whose midnight ride in 1775 symbolized the quest for liberty as he informed fellow Americans of the impending battle for their rights;</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas Crispus Attucks, a man of African and Native American descent, became a martyr in the fight for liberty, making the ultimate sacrifice as the first casualty of the American Revolution in the Boston Massacre of 1770, personifying the high cost of liberty;</text></whereas>

<whereas><text>Whereas John Brown’s sacrifice in the face of oppressive powers was a demonstration of his profound belief in liberty;</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas John Brown’s liberation tactics played a pivotal role in pushing our Nation toward the fulfillment of its founding principles of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness;</text></whereas> 
<whereas><text>Whereas recognition of John Brown’s contribution to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness fosters a better understanding of the struggles faced in our journey toward the abolition of the horrific crime against humanity known as slavery;</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas John Brown’s life and legacy evoke reflection on our Nation’s history and the high cost of liberty;</text></whereas> 
<whereas><text>Whereas, like Crispus Attucks, John Brown should be honored for sacrificing his life in the name of liberty; and</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas, just as Paul Revere’s midnight ride was a harbinger of the battle between the colonies and Britain to come, John Brown’s raid on the Federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry to initiate a slave revolution was a harbinger of the war between slave and free States to come: Now, therefore, be it</text></whereas></preamble><resolution-body style="OLC" id="H4326FF6876844C6193C624C638FE7FBC">
