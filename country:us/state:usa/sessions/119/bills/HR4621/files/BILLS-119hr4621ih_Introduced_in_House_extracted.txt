Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the 320th Barrage Balloon Battalion Gold Medal Act.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following: 
(1)The 320th Barrage Balloon Battalion was formed on September 21, 1942, just a year after the Coastal Artillery Corps took over responsibility for barrage balloons from the Army Air Corps. Their first combat assignment was at the Utah and Omaha beaches in Normandy, France, for the D-Day invasion.  (2) The Soldiers of the Battalion played a crucial role in protecting the Allied forces during the D-Day invasion by deploying barrage balloons to prevent enemy aircraft from targeting the invasion forces directly. Their bravery and determination exemplify the valor and dedication of African-American soldiers during World War II.
       

        (3)
 The 320th Barrage Balloon Battalion was unique at Normandy for two reasons. First, it was the only American barrage balloon unit in France and second, it was the first and only segregated unit of African-American Soldiers to land on the beaches during D-Day.
       
(4)The brave men of the 320th Barrage Balloon Battalion faced intense enemy fire during the D-Day invasion. Their mission was to raise hydrogen-filled barrage balloons to protect assaulting infantry and armor from being strafed by enemy aircraft. The balloons flew at an altitude of around 200 feet to defend soldiers landing on the beaches against strafing attacks by German aircraft. (5)The 320th Barrage Balloon Battalion came up with an ingenious solution to one problem they had during the landing. They refitted RL–31 Signal Corps field cable winches with barrage balloon reels, which weighed only 35 pounds and were mounted in the back of a jeep to deploy and control balloons on D-Day. 

        (6)
 Despite the severe conditions and many balloons being shot down, the battalion successfully deployed their balloons which resulted in the downing of a German JU–SS aircraft, significantly contributing to the overall security and success of the invasion and the Allied victory.
       
(7)Additionally, at approximately 10:15 A.M. on June 6, 1944, five battalion medics with the 320th were the first to land on Omaha Beach, with crews of three-to-four men joining them shortly after U.S. Army Corporal Waverly B. Woodson, Jr., was among them. (8)Corporal Woodson was injured when his Landing Craft, Tank (LCT 856) hit a sea mine and was, then, struck by an artillery shell. Despite his injuries, Woodson continued to perform his duties, conducting an amputation, setting limbs and removing bullets over a 30-hour period. He even revived three men via artificial respiration. His efforts on D-Day are believed to have saved 200 soldiers, and he was recommended for the Medal of Honor by General John C.H. Lee, but never received it. 
(9)The 320th Barrage Balloon Battalion served 110 days in France, providing vital air defense during the critical early stages of the invasion. In late July 1944, Battery A of the 320th moved from Omaha Beach to the port city of Cherbourg, while the remaining batteries stayed on Omaha and Utah Beaches until early October, when deteriorating weather prevented ships from landing. (10)Following their service in the European Theater, the 320th underwent training at Camp Stewart, Georgia, prior to their deployment to the Pacific. On May 6, 1945, the 320th arrived in Oahu, Hawaii, in support of the proposed Allied invasion of Japan which never took place. 
(11)A commendation by Supreme Allied Commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower cited the unit for conducting its mission with courage and determination, proving to be an important element of the air defense team. Despite their significant contributions, the 320th Barrage Balloon Battalion has not received the recognition it deserves in the annals of World War II history. (12)Henry Parham, the last surviving member of this unit, died in July 2021. His passing marked the end of an era, marking it fitting to honor the memory and service of these brave men. 

        (13)
 The story of the 320th Barrage Balloon Battalion serves as a powerful reminder of the contributions and sacrifices of African-American soldiers in World War II, whose patriotic commitment and perseverance in the face of adversity during D-Day deserve national recognition and commemoration.
