Whereas Father’s Day recognizes and raises awareness of the importance of fathers in the United States; Whereas Father’s Day was established in 1966 by then-President Lyndon Johnson issuing a proclamation setting aside the third Sunday in June to honor fathers; 
Whereas Father’s Day has been celebrated annually since 1972, when then-President Richard Nixon signed a law making it a permanent national holiday; Whereas, throughout the history of the United States, whether in their homes, workplaces, schools, and communities, fathers have fought for themselves, their families, and all people of the United States; 
Whereas 6 in 10 adult men in the United States are fathers; Whereas 29,000,000 of these fathers are also grandfathers; 
Whereas fathers are just as likely as mothers to say that parenting is extremely important to their identity; Whereas, since 1965, fathers in the United States have nearly tripled the time they spend caring for children; 
Whereas there are 3,050,000 men who are solo fathers to a minor; Whereas children with involved loving fathers are significantly more likely to do well in school, and exhibit greater emotional security, curiosity, and math and verbal skills; 
Whereas toddlers with involved fathers go to school with higher levels of academic readiness, and they are more patient when handling stress associated with attending school; Whereas the positive impacts of having an engaged father persist into adolescence and adulthood, resulting in higher intellectual functioning, better verbal skills, and higher academic achievement; 
Whereas children with involved fathers have higher self-esteem and fewer behavioral problems at school; Whereas fathers who take 2 or more weeks off after the birth of a child are more involved in that child’s direct care 9 months after birth than fathers who take no leave; 
Whereas a father’s involvement in his newborn’s care in the first 6 months can mean both mother and baby sleep better; Whereas a mother’s income rises 7 percent for each month of leave their child’s father takes; 
Whereas policies that provide support to fathers ensure that families and children thrive while also benefiting fathers’ physical and mental health; Whereas universal paid family and medical leave will give fathers the freedom to care for themselves and their loved ones; 
Whereas affordable, accessible, high-quality child care with family sustaining wages for early educators will help fathers support their children’s healthy development; Whereas a permanent, fully inclusive, monthly child tax credit will put consistent resources into the hands of fathers caring for children; and 
Whereas Sunday, June 15, 2025, will be widely celebrated across the United States as Father’s Day: Now, therefore, be it That the House of Representatives—
(1)recognizes the role of fathers in the United States; (2)urges support for universal paid family and medical leave, affordable, accessible, high-quality child care, and a permanent, fully inclusive, monthly child tax credit;
(3)acknowledges that fathers can, and should, be celebrated and supported as an integral part of families, communities, workplaces, and society; and (4)supports the designation of a Father’s Day.
