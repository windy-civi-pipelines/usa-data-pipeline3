Section 1:
1.FindingsCongress finds the following: (1)The United States has a core national security and economic interest in maintaining leadership in deep sea science and technology and seabed mineral resources. 
(2)The United States faces unprecedented economic and national security challenges in securing reliable supplies of critical minerals independent of foreign adversary control. (3)Vast offshore seabed areas hold critical minerals and energy resources. 
(4)These resources are key to strengthening our economy, securing our energy future, and reducing dependence on foreign suppliers for critical minerals. (5)The United States also controls seabed mineral resources in one of the largest ocean areas of the world. 
(6)Our Nation can, through the exercise of existing authorities and by establishing international partnerships, access potentially vast resources in seabed polymetallic nodules, other subsea geologic structures, and coastal deposits containing strategic minerals such as nickel, cobalt, copper, manganese, titanium, and rare earth elements, which are vital to our national security and economic prosperity. (7)Our Nation must take immediate action to accelerate the responsible development of seabed mineral resources, quantify the Nation’s endowment of seabed minerals, reinvigorate American leadership in associated extraction and processing technologies, and ensure secure supply chains for our defense, infrastructure, and energy sectors. 
(8)It is the policy of the United States to advance United States leadership in seabed mineral development by— (A)rapidly developing domestic capabilities for the exploration, characterization, collection, and processing of seabed mineral resources through streamlined permitting without compromising environmental and transparency standards; 
(B)supporting investment in deep sea science, mapping, and technology; (C)enhancing coordination among executive departments and agencies with respect to seabed mineral development activities described in this Act; 
(D)establishing the United States as a global leader in responsible seabed mineral exploration, development technologies, and practices, and as a partner for countries developing seabed mineral resources in areas within their national jurisdictions, including their exclusive economic zones; (E)creating a robust domestic supply chain for critical minerals derived from seabed mineral resources to support economic growth, reindustrialization, and military preparedness, including through new processing capabilities; and 
(F)strengthening partnerships with allies and industry to counter China’s growing influence over seabed mineral resources and to ensure United States companies are well-positioned to support allies and partners interested in developing seabed minerals responsibly in areas within their national jurisdictions, including their exclusive economic zones.
