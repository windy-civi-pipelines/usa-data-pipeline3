IV119th CONGRESS1st SessionH. RES. 755IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESSeptember 19, 2025Mr. Smith of New Jersey (for himself and Mr. Doggett) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and CommerceRESOLUTIONExpressing support for the goals and ideas of National Hydrocephalus Awareness Month and World Hydrocephalus Day. 
Whereas hydrocephalus, an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, is a life-threatening condition that affects approximately 1,000,000 people in the United States with an incidence rate globally of 85 per 100,000 individuals; Whereas 1 out of every 770 babies will develop hydrocephalus; 
Whereas it is estimated that 800,000 older Americans may be living with normal pressure hydrocephalus, of which 80 percent of cases are believed to be undiagnosed and untreated; Whereas anyone at any age can develop hydrocephalus; 
Whereas the annual hospital charges related to hydrocephalus medical costs nationally are over $2,000,000,000 per year; Whereas, since 2000, more than 470,000 United States servicemembers have sustained a traumatic brain injury (TBI), one cause of hydrocephalus; 
Whereas it is estimated that 14 percent of these patriots who suffered a severe TBI could develop hydrocephalus; Whereas there is no cure for hydrocephalus, and the only treatment is costly brain surgery which frequently must be repeated to replace the shunt, a medical device that is the most common treatment for the condition and has one of the highest failure rates of all medical devices; 
Whereas over 36,000 shunt surgeries are performed each year (one every 15 minutes), and more than half represent emergencies; Whereas there are approximately 10,000 pediatric hospital admissions for shunt malfunctions each year; 
Whereas approximately 23,000 young adults between the ages of 18 to 22 must transition from pediatric to adult health care each year, yet these young adults experience significant barriers impacting continuity of care, including a lack of adult-focused neurosurgeons willing to take them as patients; Whereas the Hydrocephalus Association and other organizations, such as the Pediatric Hydrocephalus Foundation, serve as global leaders for hydrocephalus awareness, education, support, advocacy, and research funding; and 
Whereas the Pediatric Hydrocephalus Foundation and the Hydrocephalus Association recognize September as National Hydrocephalus Awareness Month and September 20 as World Hydrocephalus Day: Now, therefore, be it That the House of Representatives— 
(1)support the goals and ideas of National Hydrocephalus Month and World Hydrocephalus Day; and (2)continue to support research to prevent, detect, and treat hydrocephalus.
