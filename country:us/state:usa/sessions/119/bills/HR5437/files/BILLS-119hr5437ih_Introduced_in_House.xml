<paragraph id="H48F7217D4B9C4737AAF2D5919257F5BA"><enum>(1)</enum><text>Civil actions have been commenced against manufacturers and sellers of certain stone slab products, including those used for kitchen countertops and similar applications. These products are not inherently dangerous and upon their manufacture and entry into the stream of commerce, they do not pose an inherent risk of injury to human beings.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H2876D166EB4F4E949A6F82978EE3CCC5"><enum>(2)</enum><text>These civil actions seek money damages from manufacturers and sellers by persons who claim personal injuries as a result of exposure to silica dust produced during the alteration of such products in the course of their employment by third-party fabricators. The manufacturers and sellers of these products have no control over these fabricators.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HDE09E87098D44E37BCB1464B9EAAA940"><enum>(3)</enum><text>The alteration of such products is heavily regulated by Federal and State workplace safety laws and regulations, including section 1910.1053 of title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, and California Labor Code Section 5204, which require a variety of safety measures that fabricators must employ in order to mitigate the risk of potential injuries posed by silica dust. However, some fabricators fail to comply with these requirements and thereby expose their employees and others to the potential harms that these laws and regulations are intended to prevent.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H7F5638D84D1E4EB39AB2F5C12E228E47"><enum>(4)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Businesses located or conducting business in the United States that are engaged in interstate and foreign commerce through the lawful design, manufacture, marketing, distribution, importation, or sale to third-parties of certain stone slab products are not responsible, and should not be held liable, for the alleged injuries caused by those who alter the product in a way that is unsafe or violates Federal and State laws and regulations.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H40F24DAA9DE846CBB2A2307863570887"><enum>(5)</enum><text>The possibility of imposing liability on an entire industry for alleged injuries that are solely caused by others is an abuse of the legal system, erodes public confidence in our Nation’s laws, invites the disassembly and destabilization of other industries and economic sectors lawfully competing in the free enterprise system of the United States, and constitutes an unreasonable burden on interstate and foreign commerce of the United States.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H1E9988A3E5704F67BCE0C0F732F73621"><enum>(6)</enum><text>A proliferation of frivolous lawsuits against manufacturers and sellers of stone slab products for alleged workplace injuries caused by the actions of third-parties unrelated to and beyond the control of these manufacturers and sellers may further limit access to courts by straining the resources of the legal system and depriving deserving parties of their legitimate rights to relief.</text></paragraph></subsection>
