Section 3:
3.FindingsCongress finds the following:(1)Public school teachers in the United States have one of the toughest, most demanding, and most under-appreciated jobs in the United States.(2)In the majority of States, public elementary and secondary school teachers do not earn a livable and competitive salary. According to the 2024 report by the Economic Policy Institute, on average, teachers in 2023 earned 5.1 percent less than teachers did in 1996, while during the same time period, the wages for other similarly-educated professionals increased by 30 percent.(3)Many teachers across the country are working multiple jobs and have to rely on public assistance programs just to make ends meet. According to the Southern Regional Education Board, in 36 States, the average teacher salary is low enough that mid-career teachers who are the head of household for a family of 4 qualify for government benefits. According to a University of California, Berkeley study, between 2014 and 2016, 21 percent of elementary and middle school teachers were part of families enrolled in at least one of the following public assistance programs:(A)The Earned Income Tax Credit under section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.(B)The Medicaid program.(C)The Children’s Health Insurance program.(D)The supplemental nutrition assistance program established under the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 (7 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.).(E)The program of block grants to States for temporary assistance for needy families established under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.).(4)One estimate shows that in school year 2020–2021, 17 percent of public school teachers worked multiple jobs during the school year, such as working in restaurants or driving for ride-share platforms.(5)The reality for paraprofessionals and education support staff is even more troubling. In school year 2022–23, full-time workers earned on average $33,756, with 38 percent of workers earning less than $25,000 and 12.5 percent earning less than $15,000. This is no way to treat the critical school staff who manage our school grounds, keep our students safe, drive them to school, and work in our Nation’s classrooms.(6)According to the National Education Association, the average starting teacher salary in the United States was $44,530 in the 2022–2023 school year. This is an increase of 3.9 percent over the previous school year. 28.6 percent of school districts pay their starting teachers less than $40,000, and those districts employ 17.9 percent of teachers nationwide. Only 12.9 percent of starting teachers nationwide earn a salary of $60,000 or more. Nationwide, 38 percent of teachers earn less than $60,000.(7)According to a 2022 study from the Annenberg Institute at Brown University, the most recent national data shows that nearly 200,000 teaching positions were either vacant or held by underqualified teachers. This study, and others, consistently demonstrate that teacher shortages disproportionately impact schools serving the most students of color and from low-income backgrounds.(8)Nearly 70 years after Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), required the provision of public education to all people on equal terms, children of color, children with disabilities, and children in low-income communities are routinely denied a high-quality education. The Civil Rights Data Collection of the Office for Civil Rights of the Department of Education shows that schools with high enrollment of students of color are 4 times as likely to employ uncertified teachers compared to schools with low enrollment of students of color. Additional studies show that teachers with less than 3 years of experience are concentrated in schools serving a high percentage of students from low-income backgrounds and students of color.(9)Research, including a study by the Economic Policy Institute, has found that raising teacher salaries helps attract youth into teaching, encourages teachers to teach in underserved schools, improves teacher retention and morale, and bolsters student academic outcomes. According to the Learning Policy Institute, controlling for other factors, teachers employed by local educational agencies with the highest salary schedules are 31 percent less likely to leave than teachers employed by local educational agencies with lower pay scales.(10)According to the Consortium for Policy Research in Education at the University of Pennsylvania, teachers who enter the profession through comprehensive and high-quality pathways are 2 to 3 times more likely to remain in the profession than underprepared teachers who enter through less than comprehensive pathways.(11)Several studies have shown the many benefits of providing opportunities for teacher leadership, which include improving instructional practice, increasing academic and other positive outcomes for students, and increasing teacher retention.(12)Teachers in the United States are systemically underpaid compared to their similarly educated peers. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, teachers in the United States are paid 64 percent what similarly-educated professionals earn, which is a much more extreme pay gap than in other industrialized nations.(13)Raising teacher salaries to at least $60,000 a year, ensuring competitive pay throughout the lifetime of the teaching career, and empowering teachers are some of the most important steps the United States can take to address the teacher shortage crisis and ensure all students have access to qualified teachers and educational opportunity. Paying teachers as the professionals they are is critical in order to honor the work of educators, restore respect to the teaching profession, and create a high-quality public education system that serves the needs of students, families, and teachers.(14)Most paraprofessionals and education support staff are employed to work only 36 to 38 hours per week and are laid off during the summer.

According to the 2024 report by the Economic Policy Institute, on average, teachers in 2023 earned 5.1 percent less than teachers did in 1996, while during the same time period, the wages for other similarly-educated professionals increased by 30 percent.(3)Many teachers across the country are working multiple jobs and have to rely on public assistance programs just to make ends meet. According to the Southern Regional Education Board, in 36 States, the average teacher salary is low enough that mid-career teachers who are the head of household for a family of 4 qualify for government benefits. According to a University of California, Berkeley study, between 2014 and 2016, 21 percent of elementary and middle school teachers were part of families enrolled in at least one of the following public assistance programs:(A)The Earned Income Tax Credit under section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.(B)The Medicaid program.(C)The Children’s Health Insurance program.(D)The supplemental nutrition assistance program established under the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 (7 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.).(E)The program of block grants to States for temporary assistance for needy families established under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.).(4)One estimate shows that in school year 2020–2021, 17 percent of public school teachers worked multiple jobs during the school year, such as working in restaurants or driving for ride-share platforms.(5)The reality for paraprofessionals and education support staff is even more troubling. In school year 2022–23, full-time workers earned on average $33,756, with 38 percent of workers earning less than $25,000 and 12.5 percent earning less than $15,000. This is no way to treat the critical school staff who manage our school grounds, keep our students safe, drive them to school, and work in our Nation’s classrooms.(6)According to the National Education Association, the average starting teacher salary in the United States was $44,530 in the 2022–2023 school year. This is an increase of 3.9 percent over the previous school year. 28.6 percent of school districts pay their starting teachers less than $40,000, and those districts employ 17.9 percent of teachers nationwide. Only 12.9 percent of starting teachers nationwide earn a salary of $60,000 or more. Nationwide, 38 percent of teachers earn less than $60,000.(7)According to a 2022 study from the Annenberg Institute at Brown University, the most recent national data shows that nearly 200,000 teaching positions were either vacant or held by underqualified teachers. This study, and others, consistently demonstrate that teacher shortages disproportionately impact schools serving the most students of color and from low-income backgrounds.(8)Nearly 70 years after Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), required the provision of public education to all people on equal terms, children of color, children with disabilities, and children in low-income communities are routinely denied a high-quality education. The Civil Rights Data Collection of the Office for Civil Rights of the Department of Education shows that schools with high enrollment of students of color are 4 times as likely to employ uncertified teachers compared to schools with low enrollment of students of color. Additional studies show that teachers with less than 3 years of experience are concentrated in schools serving a high percentage of students from low-income backgrounds and students of color.(9)Research, including a study by the Economic Policy Institute, has found that raising teacher salaries helps attract youth into teaching, encourages teachers to teach in underserved schools, improves teacher retention and morale, and bolsters student academic outcomes. According to the Learning Policy Institute, controlling for other factors, teachers employed by local educational agencies with the highest salary schedules are 31 percent less likely to leave than teachers employed by local educational agencies with lower pay scales.(10)According to the Consortium for Policy Research in Education at the University of Pennsylvania, teachers who enter the profession through comprehensive and high-quality pathways are 2 to 3 times more likely to remain in the profession than underprepared teachers who enter through less than comprehensive pathways.(11)Several studies have shown the many benefits of providing opportunities for teacher leadership, which include improving instructional practice, increasing academic and other positive outcomes for students, and increasing teacher retention.(12)Teachers in the United States are systemically underpaid compared to their similarly educated peers. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, teachers in the United States are paid 64 percent what similarly-educated professionals earn, which is a much more extreme pay gap than in other industrialized nations.(13)Raising teacher salaries to at least $60,000 a year, ensuring competitive pay throughout the lifetime of the teaching career, and empowering teachers are some of the most important steps the United States can take to address the teacher shortage crisis and ensure all students have access to qualified teachers and educational opportunity. Paying teachers as the professionals they are is critical in order to honor the work of educators, restore respect to the teaching profession, and create a high-quality public education system that serves the needs of students, families, and teachers.(14)Most paraprofessionals and education support staff are employed to work only 36 to 38 hours per week and are laid off during the summer.4.DefinitionsIn this Act:(1)Annual adjustment percentageThe term annual adjustment percentage, with respect to appropriations made under this Act for a fiscal year, means a percentage equal to the estimated percentage change in the Consumer Price Index, as determined by the Secretary of Education, for the most recent calendar year ending prior to the beginning of such fiscal year.(2)Consumer price indexThe term Consumer Price Index has the meaning given the term in section 478(f) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1087rr(f)).(3)SecretaryThe term Secretary means the Secretary of Education.5.Regulations;
