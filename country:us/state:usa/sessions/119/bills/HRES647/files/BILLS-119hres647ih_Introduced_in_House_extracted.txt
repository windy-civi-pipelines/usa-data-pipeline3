        IV
        119th CONGRESS
        1st Session
        H. RES. 647
        IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
        
            August 12, 2025
            Mr. Carter of Georgia submitted the
                following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Ethics
        
        RESOLUTION
        Condemning remarks made by Representative Delia Ramirez of
            Illinois declaring her allegiance to the Republic of Guatemala before the United States
            of America.
    
    
        
 Whereas Representative Delia Ramirez of Illinois declared I’m a proud Guatemalan before I’m an American;
        
        
 Whereas members of Congress are elected to represent constituents residing in their district in the United States of America, not foreign nations;
        
        
 Whereas Americans place their trust in elected members of Congress to represent their interests in the Federal Government;
        
        
 Whereas members of Congress take an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; and
        
        
 Whereas Representative Ramirez’s comments have cast doubt on whether she puts the interests of her constituents before those of the people of the Republic of Guatemala: Now, therefore, be it
        
    
    
        
 That the House of Representatives—  (1) condemns the anti-American comments made by Representative Delia Ramirez of Illinois;
            
            
                (2)
 affirms its allegiance to always put the interests of American citizens before those of other nations;
            
            
                (3)
 condemns comments that put the interests of foreign nations above those of the United States; and
            
            
                (4)
 affirms its commitment to always put the safety, prosperity, and overall well-being of the American people first before those of other nations.
