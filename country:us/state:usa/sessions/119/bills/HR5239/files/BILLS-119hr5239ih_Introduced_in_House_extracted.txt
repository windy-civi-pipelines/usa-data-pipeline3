Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Endometrial Cancer Research and Education Act of 2025.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following: 
(1)Endometrial cancer is cancer of the lining of the uterus (or endometrium) and is the most common form of uterine cancer. (2)Endometrial cancer is the fourth most common cancer diagnosed in women, after breast, lung, and colon cancer. 
(3)Endometrial cancer mainly affects postmenopausal women, with most women diagnosed between age 55 and 64. (4)Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and uterine leiomyoma have an increased risk of developing endometrial cancer. 
(5)Unlike most other types of cancer, the incidence of endometrial cancer, particularly aggressive subtypes of such cancer, has been increasing in the United States among all women, particularly among African-American and Asian women, with a 2.5 annual percent change for both groups. (6)In comparison to non-Hispanic White women, African-American women have significantly higher incidence rates of aggressive endometrial cancers. 
(7)Such incidence rates for Hispanic and Asian women are equal to or lower than such incidence rates for non-Hispanic White women. (8)Although non-Hispanic White women are more likely to be diagnosed with endometrial cancer in comparison to African-American women, the rate of mortality is higher for African-American women. 
(9)Currently, the cause of such disparity is unknown. Researchers are proposing investigative studies that link this disparity to the relationship between delays in care, aggressive late-stage diagnosis, and the time between diagnosis and beginning treatment protocol for their cancer type. These factors are often exacerbated by socioeconomic conditions that affect access to innovative treatment, treatment completion, patient-reported outcomes, and overall quality of life.
