RES. 21IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATESSeptember 3, 2025Mr. Scott of Florida submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the JudiciaryCONCURRENT RESOLUTIONDenouncing the horrors of socialism.Whereas socialist ideology necessitates a concentration of power that has, time and time again, collapsed into communist regimes, totalitarian rule, and brutal dictatorships;Whereas socialism has repeatedly led to famine and mass murders, and the killing of over 100,000,000 people worldwide;Whereas many of the greatest crimes in history were committed by socialist ideologues, including Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, Mao Zedong, Fidel Castro, Pol Pot, Kim Jong Il, Kim Jong Un, Daniel Ortega, Hugo Chavez, and Nicol√°s Maduro;Whereas tens of millions died in the Bolshevik Revolution, at least 10,000,000 people were sent to the gulags in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and millions more starved in the Terror-Famine (Holodomor) in Ukraine;Whereas between 15,000,000 and 55,000,000 people starved to death in the wake of famine and devastation caused by the Great Leap Forward in China;Whereas the socialist experiment in Cambodia led to the killing fields in which over a million people were gruesomely murdered;Whereas up to 3,500,000 people have starved in North Korea, dividing a land of freedom from a land of destitution;Whereas the Castro regime in Cuba expropriated the land of Cuban farmers and the businesses of Cuban entrepreneurs, stealing their possessions and their livelihoods, and exiling millions with nothing but the clothes on their backs;Whereas the implementation of socialism in Venezuela has turned a once-prosperous country into a failed State with the highest rate of inflation in the world;Whereas President Thomas Jefferson, the author of the Declaration of Independence, wrote, To take from one, because it is thought that his own industry and that of his fathers has acquired too much, in order to spare to others, who, or whose fathers have not exercised equal industry and skill, is to violate arbitrarily the first principle of association, the guarantee to every one of a free exercise of his industry, and the fruits acquired by it;Whereas President James Madison, the Father of the Constitution, wrote that it is not a just government, nor is property secure under it, where the property which a man has in his personal safety and personal liberty, is violated by arbitrary seizures of one class of citizens for the service of the rest; andWhereas the United States was founded on the belief in the sanctity of the individual, to which the collectivistic system of socialism in all of its forms is fundamentally and necessarily opposed: Now, therefore, be itThat Congress denounces socialism in all its forms, and opposes the implementation of socialist policies in the United States.
