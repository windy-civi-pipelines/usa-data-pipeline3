Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following:

(3)Understaffing at Bureau of Prison institutions will also result in reduced staff safety, escalated workplace abuse, stressful work conditions, enhanced mental and physical health concerns, and unacceptably long work shifts for employees. (4)Mandated overtime, misuse of augmentation or reassignment, and overworked employees will reduce prison security and threaten public safety.
