Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the National Gun Violence Research Act of 2025.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress makes the following findings: 
(1)In the last 50 years, more individuals in the United States have died from gunshots than in all wars in which the United States was a combatant, combined. (2)The rate of gun violence deaths in the United States is more than 11 times that of other high-income nations. 
(3)Guns accounted for 79 percent of homicides and 55 percent of suicides in 2023, totaling over 45,000 deaths in the United States. (4)Gun violence disproportionately affects communities of color. In 2022, Black Americans were 12 times as likely as White Americans to be killed by gun violence while Hispanic and Latino Americans were twice as likely to be killed. 
(5)Provisions in appropriations Acts dating back to 1996 have had a chilling effect on Federal funding for research on gun violence across the Federal Government and, as a result, research on gun violence is significantly underfunded relative to other leading causes of death. (6)Research examining the nature, causes, consequences, and prevention of gun-related violence, suicide, and unintentional injury and death does not constitute advocacy in support of, or opposition to, gun control policies or regulations. 
(7)More research and high-quality data relating to gun violence are needed to inform the development of effective strategies to reduce the incidence of gun-related injury and death.
