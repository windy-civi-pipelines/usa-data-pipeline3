III119th CONGRESS1st SessionS. RES. 277IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATESJune 12, 2025Mr. Lee submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the JudiciaryRESOLUTIONSupporting the designation of June as Fidelity Month for the purpose of rededicating the United States to the values of faith, family, and patriotism.Whereas a recent opinion poll of Americans showed support for traditional values has significantly declined;Whereas a majority of Americans no longer view values like faith, family, patriotism, or being involved in the community as very important;Whereas these values used to unite Americans;Whereas the decline in these values has corresponded with a rise in crime, drug abuse, alienation, and family disintegration;Whereas fidelity means dedication to faith, spouses and families, and country and communities;Whereas citizens of all faiths can join in recommitting the United States to fidelity;Whereas John Adams, a founding father of the United States, said, Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.;Whereas survival of the United States depends on the shared bonds of faith, family, and patriotism; andWhereas it is fitting to observe one month each year to rededicate the United States to its core values: Now, therefore, be itThat it is the sense of the Senate that June should be designated as Fidelity Month for the purpose of rededicating the United States to the values of faith, family, and patriotism.
