Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Strengthening Capacity for Disaster Resilient Territories Act.

Section 2:
2.Findings and purpose(a)FindingsCongress makes the following findings:(1)The United States territories are particularly vulnerable to extreme weather events, which have become more frequent and stronger in recent years.(2)Category–5 Hurricane María, which made its landfall in Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017, is considered to be the second deadliest storm recorded in United States history.(3)Category–5 Hurricane Irma, which struck the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico on September 6, 2017, is considered to be the second-most intense tropical cyclone worldwide in 2017.(4)Typhoon Mawar, which struck Guam on May 19, 2023, and the south of Rota, Northern Mariana Islands on May 24, 2023, is considered to be the strongest to hit Guam since 2002.(5)Super Typhoon Yutu, which struck the Northern Mariana Islands on October 24, 2018, is considered to be the strongest typhoon recorded to impact the Mariana Islands.(6)Hurricane Fiona made its landfall as a Category–1 Hurricane in Puerto Rico on September 18, 2022, causing severe flooding and compounding the damage left by Hurricanes Irma and María.(7)A major disaster declaration was issued for the territory of American Samoa on September 15, 2022, due to high surf, high winds, and flooding.(8)Rising sea levels, caused by ocean warming, contribute to the increased frequency and intensity of hurricanes, and the fragile condition of coastal environments in the United States territories. This translates to disrupted economic activity, such as tourism, agriculture and fishing, damaged dwellings, and limited drinking water supplies.(9)The Federal Emergency Management Agency (hereinafter referred to as FEMA) has obligated significant amounts of funding to address multiple natural disasters in the United States territories.(10)As of September 2025, FEMA had obligated $10,382,528,245 under the Public Assistance and Hazard Mitigation programs to address damages caused by Hurricane María in Puerto Rico. In addition, as of September 2025, FEMA had obligated $2,497,729,050 under the Public Assistance and Hazard Mitigation programs to address damages caused by Hurricane Fiona in Puerto Rico.(11)As of August 2022, FEMA had obligated $4,200,000,000 under the Public Assistance program and $138,200,000 under the Hazard Mitigation program to address damages caused by Hurricanes Irma and María in the Virgin Islands.(12)After the passage of Typhoon Mangkhut and Super Typhoon Yutu in Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands, FEMA obligated a total of $677,200,000 between 2018 and 2020 to aid response and recovery efforts related to both disasters.(13)The United States territories have similar vulnerabilities that result in long and difficult recovery processes.(14)The economies of the United States territories depend heavily on tourism to create revenue. Such dependency undermines disaster resiliency, given the industry’s susceptibility to external shocks, such as atmospheric conditions, financial crises, and global pandemics. Any of this phenomenon can reduce the number of visitors and trigger the closure of businesses and lay-offs.(15)The United States territories struggle with high levels of public debt, which impact their ability to provide cash advances to initiate disaster recovery projects. Notably—(A)Puerto Rico is in the midst of debt restructuring proceedings that, as of 2025, have reduced Puerto Rico’s public debt from over $70,000,000,000 to $31,000,000,000 and pension liabilities from $55,000,000,000 to $7,000,000,000;(B)as of September 2021, Virgin Islands’ public debt stood at $2,200,000,000, representing 50 percent of its gross domestic product; and(C)as of September 2023, Guam’s public debt stood at $2,500,000, representing 38 percent of its gross domestic product.(16)The physical infrastructure of the United States territories, including electricity grids and water plants, is outdated, and has lacked appropriate maintenance and hardening.(17)The United States territories face housing affordability and availability challenges that impact their ability to absorb the influx of the recovery workforce after a disaster occurs.(18)The United States territories are situated in remote locations, which results in higher import costs, significant delays in the shipping and transportation of construction materials necessary to carry out recovery projects, and barriers for staff seeking to travel to the continental United States to receive recovery training.(19)The United States territories have limited specialized staff to adequately navigate and manage recovery programs, including developing projects for obligation, using Public Assistance to cover administrative and managerial costs, and procuring goods and services according to Federal standards.(20)The United States territories hurdle to find and procure specialized personnel to advance recovery efforts, such as engineers and construction contractors, given the high demand for these professionals by public agencies and large corporations in the aftermath of disasters.(21)The United States territories struggle with dangerous demographic patterns that exacerbate social, financial, and economic fragilities. From 2010 to 2020, the populations of the territories shrunk, and at a faster pace than any other continental state. In such period, Puerto Rico’s population was reduced by 11.8 percent, U.S. Virgin Islands’ population by 18.1 percent, Northern Mariana Islands’ population by 12.2 percent, American Samoa’s population by 10.5 percent, and Guam’s population by 3.5 percent. Additionally, the islands are experiencing lower birthrates and higher death rates.(22)The postal addresses used in the United States territories have not been recognized and registered by the United States Postal Service, which can result in additional obstacles for recovery, primarily for individuals and households seeking to obtain FEMA assistance.(23)The United States territories have endured consecutive major disasters, which has made it more difficult for FEMA to correctly assess recent and older damages, and therefore obligate funding for Public Assistance projects.(24)The United States territories encompass a variety of languages, political sensitivities, and cultural differences that Federal authorities like FEMA have not traditionally considered, thereby impacting the territories’ full and equal participation in Federal disaster recovery programs.(b)Statement of purposeIt is the purpose of this Act to establish a program within FEMA to continuously identify, monitor, and address factors and capability gaps that hinder the execution and completion of recovery activities by eligible entities located in the territories of the United States under sections 403, 404, 406, 407, and 502 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.).
