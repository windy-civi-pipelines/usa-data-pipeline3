Section 1:
1.FindingsCongress finds the following:(1)On May 1, 1966, during Operation Birmingham in the Vietnam War, then-Captain Robert J. Graham launched his F–100 Super Sabre from an alert pad at Bien Hoa Air Base, despite being grounded due to driving monsoon conditions. Alongside his flight leader, he provided close air support to an Army fire base which was under heavy attack by enemy forces.(2)During the first strike pass, Capt. Graham’s plane sustained severe damage from enemy anti-aircraft artillery (AAA) to the fuel boost pumps. Despite the loss, he skillfully kept his engine running by relying solely on gravity fuel flow, forcing him to fly barely above stall speed in hazardous weather.(3)As Capt. Graham attempted to return to base with his crippled plane, an urgent request came in for support at another army base, which was being attacked by over 4,000 North Vietnamese troops, with the enemy about to breach the concertina wire perimeter.(4)Despite his battle-damaged plane and his own survival highly unlikely, Captain Graham carried on and executed strikes against enemy forces under the guns of friendly Army defenders, a feat never attempted in combat.(5)With complete disregard for his own safety, Capt. Graham made more than 15 passes, destroying all eight North Vietnamese AAA gun positions, neutralizing over 1,500 enemy troops, and saving hundreds of American lives.(6)His actions turned the tide of the battle and remain a testament to the highest ideals of service and sacrifice.(7)For his actions in Operation Birmingham on May 1, 1966, Capt. Graham was awarded the Silver Star.(8)Ret. Col. Graham served four tours in Vietnam and flew more than 500 combat missions. He enlisted in the United States Air Force in 1953 and after completing basic training and flight school, he continued to serve 26 years as a fighter pilot.(9)Ret. Col. Robert J. Graham deserves the Congressional Medal of Honor for his heroic actions on May 1, 1966, going above and beyond the call of duty, where his undaunted courage in the face of danger saved the lives of hundreds of his fellow Americans.
