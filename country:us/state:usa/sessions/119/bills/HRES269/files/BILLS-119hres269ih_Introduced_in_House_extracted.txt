Whereas HBCUs consistently overproduce in outcomes, graduating nearly 50 percent of Black teachers, 70 percent of Black dentists, and 80 percent of Black judges nationwide; Whereas HBCUs are not just historic, they are essential, and they contribute nearly $16,500,000,000 annually to the United States economy, support more than 134,000 jobs, and serve as economic anchors in communities across the United States; 
Whereas HBCUs are engines of workforce development and economic mobility, advancing student success, conducting community-based research, and strengthening pathways to career-connected learning; Whereas HBCUs are national leaders in science, agriculture, public health, education, and innovation, conducting impactful research in laboratories, community centers, and campuses across the country in partnership with Federal agencies and the private sector; 
Whereas HBCUs thrive through investment, maximizing opportunity and expanding access to higher education; and Whereas HBCUs are incubators of excellence, where no matter your background, income, or ZIP Code, you receive a fair shot at a quality education and a better life: Now, therefore, be it
