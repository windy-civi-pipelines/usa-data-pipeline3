IV119th CONGRESS1st SessionH. CON. RES. 28IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESApril 14, 2025Ms. Ross (for herself, Mrs. Foushee, and Ms. Adams) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on House AdministrationCONCURRENT RESOLUTIONExpressing the sense of Congress that the votes of overseas servicemembers must be counted and honored as required under the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act. 
Whereas the right to vote is a fundamental pillar of democracy and a sacred right safeguarded by the Constitution of the United States; Whereas Congress enacted the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA) (52 U.S.C. 20301–20311) in 1986 to protect the voting rights of members of the United States Uniformed Services and overseas citizens, ensuring their ability to participate in Federal elections through absentee ballots; 
Whereas UOCAVA requires States and territories to establish procedures to guarantee the timely transmission, receipt, and counting of absentee ballots from eligible uniformed servicemembers and overseas citizens; Whereas servicemembers stationed abroad face unique and significant challenges in exercising their right to vote, including logistical barriers, mail delays, and operational demands inherent to their service to the Nation; and 
Whereas the failure to count legally cast absentee ballots from military personnel and overseas citizens undermines election integrity, disrespects their sacrifices, and weakens public trust in democratic processes: Now, therefore, be it 1.Sense of congressIt is the sense of Congress that—
