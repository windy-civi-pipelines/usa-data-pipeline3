Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Rare Earth Magnet Security Act of 2025.

Section 2:
2.Credit for production of rare earth magnets(a)In generalThe Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by inserting the following new section after section 45AA:45BB.Credit for production of rare earth magnets(a)In general(1)Allowance of creditFor purposes of section 38, the credit for production of rare earth magnets determined under this section for any taxable year is an amount equal to the sum of the credit amounts determined under subsection (b) with respect to rare earth magnets which are—(A)manufactured or produced by the taxpayer, and(B)sold by such taxpayer to an unrelated person during the taxable year.(2)Unrelated person(A)In generalFor purposes of this subsection, a taxpayer shall be treated as selling rare earth magnets to an unrelated person if such magnet is sold to such person by a person related to the taxpayer.(B)Election(i)In generalAt the election of the taxpayer (in such form and manner as the Secretary may prescribe), a sale of rare earth magnets by such taxpayer to a related person shall be deemed to have been made to an unrelated person.(ii)RequirementAs a condition of, and prior to, any election described in clause (i), the Secretary may require such information or registration as the Secretary deems necessary for purposes of preventing duplication, fraud, or any improper or excessive amount determined under paragraph (1).(b)Credit amount(1)In generalThe amount determined under this subsection is—(A)$20 per kilogram of rare earth magnets manufactured or produced in the United States by the taxpayer during the taxable year, and(B)$30 per kilogram of rare earth magnets manufactured or produced in the United States by the taxpayer during the taxable year if not less than 90 percent by weight of the component rare earth materials of such magnets are produced within the United States.(2)Phase-Out(A)In generalIn the case of any rare earth magnet manufactured or produced after December 31, 2034, the amount determined under this section with respect to such rare earth magnet shall be equal to the product of—(i)the amount determined under paragraph (1) with respect to such rare earth magnet, as determined without regard to this subsection, multiplied by(ii)the phase-out percentage described in subparagraph (B).(B)Phase-out percentageThe phase-out percentage described in this paragraph is—(i)in the case of any rare earth magnet manufactured or produced in calendar year 2035, 70 percent,(ii)in the case of any rare earth magnet manufactured or produced in calendar year 2036 or 2037, 35 percent, or(iii)in the case of any rare earth magnet manufactured or produced after December 31, 2037, 0 percent.(c)DefinitionsFor the purposes of this section—(1)Rare earth magnetThe term rare earth magnet means a permanent magnet—
