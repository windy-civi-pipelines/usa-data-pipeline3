After finding both pilots deceased, the unit came under heavy attack by North Vietnamese forces in heavily fortified positions. Amid intense combat and while surrounded, Langhorn radioed for urgent air support, coordinating minigun and rocket strikes from the gunships above, and provided covering fire from within the defensive perimeter.</text></paragraph>
