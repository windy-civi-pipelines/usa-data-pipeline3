Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Peace on the Korean Peninsula Act.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress makes the following findings:
(1)On July 27, 1953, the commander in chief of the United Nations Command signed an armistice agreement with the supreme commander of the North Korean People’s Army and the commander of the Chinese People’s Volunteers, aiming to insure a complete cessation of hostilities and of all acts of armed force in Korea until a final peaceful settlement is achieved. (2)The armistice agreement neither formally ended the war nor represented a final peaceful settlement.
(3)On April 27, 2018, in Panmunjom, the leaders of South Korea and North Korea declared that a new era of peace has begun on the Korean peninsula, and committed to declare the end of war on the Korean peninsula 65 years after the signing of the armistice agreement. (4)In its roll out of its policy towards North Korea, the Biden Administration expressed support for the Singapore framework, which identifies peace on the Korean peninsula as an objective of any future negotiations between the United States and North Korea.
(5)The United States should pursue a sustained and credible diplomatic process to achieve an end to the Korean war, and every effort should be made to avoid military confrontation with North Korea. (6)The persistence of a state of war does not serve the national interest of the United States and its allies.
(7)One major consequence of the continuation of the Korean war is that the United States does not have formal relations with North Korea, which has prevented Korean Americans with relatives in North Korea from seeing their families. (8)Approximately 100,000 Americans have relatives living in North Korea.
(9)At the Hanoi Summit in February 2019, the United States and North Korea discussed formally ending the Korean war and the exchange of diplomatic liaison offices, however these discussions did not advance due to a stalemate on nuclear and missile issues. (10)The ongoing nuclear- and ballistic-missile-related activities of North Korea continue to pose a threat to international peace and security.

Section 3:

(3)Whether, and if so, to what extent and under what conditions, travel to the DPRK for the purposes of attending to or witnessing funerals, burials, or other religious and family commemorations of relatives of United States nationals in the DPRK does or should qualify as compelling humanitarian considerations meriting issuance of Special Validation Passports to such nationals.
