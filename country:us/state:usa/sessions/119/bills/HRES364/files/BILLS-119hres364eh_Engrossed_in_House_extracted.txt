RESOLUTION
Calling upon local communities to support organizations that provide resources and aid Gold Shield Families in their time of need.

 
Whereas brave men and women across the United States serve as first responders, courageously risking their lives to protect United States communities; Whereas the families of these valiant first responders exhibit unparalleled strength, resilience, and sacrifice, supporting their loved ones in their noble service to the Nation; 
Whereas the loss of a first responder in the line of duty is a profound tragedy that leaves an enduring impact on their families, necessitating unwavering support; Whereas Gold Shield Families, families of fallen police officers, firefighters, emergency medical technicians, correction officers, emergency dispatch officers, and emergency service providers who have tragically lost their lives in the line of duty protecting and serving their communities, endure hardships and challenges while upholding the legacy of their fallen heroes; and 
Whereas nonprofits throughout the United States provide resources and support Gold Shield Families as an expression of the Nation’s enduring gratitude and appreciation for their tremendous contributions and sacrifices: Now, therefore, be it   That— 
(1)local communities throughout the United States support nonprofits that provide resources and aid Gold Shield Families during their time of hardship and grief; and (2)Gold Shield Families utilize these resources as they process their immeasurable sacrifice.
