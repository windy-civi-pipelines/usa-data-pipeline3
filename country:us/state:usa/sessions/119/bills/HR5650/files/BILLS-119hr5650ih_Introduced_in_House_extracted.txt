Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Weatherization Resilience and Adaptation Program Act.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following:
(1)Human accelerated climate change is causing significant shifts in global surface and atmospheric temperatures, accelerating the frequency of extreme weather events around the globe. (2)Extreme weather events create environmental hazards such as excessive flooding, fire, heat, wind, and drought that have catastrophic impacts on frontline communities, who experience the worst and most immediate impacts of our climate crisis and often bear the brunt of such events seasonally, creating a cyclical pattern of disruption and destruction.
(3)Individuals can take steps to prevent and mitigate the worst impacts of extreme weather events on their home and property by implementing resilience and adaptation best practices, but the cost of these solutions puts them out of reach for many households. (4)Low-income homeowners and individuals who reside in affordable housing disproportionately live in areas that face the greatest threat from extreme weather events, yet can least afford the changes to their property to make them more resilient to disasters and adapted to the changing climate.

Section 3:
3.DefinitionsIn this Act, the following definitions apply: (1)Climate changeThe term climate change means long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns.
(2)Climate-driven hazardsThe term climate-driven hazards means hazards, such as floods, wildfires, landslides, extreme heat, extreme wind, and atmospheric rivers that have a human, economic, and ecological impact with increased frequency. (3)DirectorThe term Director means the Director of National Institute of Standards and Technology.
(4)Eligible program participantThe term eligible program participant means— (A)a State;

(D)an owner of a property used as a community of manufactured homes. (6)Low-incomeThe term low-income means income in relation to family size that is at or below 300 percent of the poverty level determined in accordance with criteria established by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, except that the Secretary may allow an eligible program participant to use a higher level if, after receiving a justification from such eligible program participant, the Secretary determines that such a higher level is necessary to carry out the purposes of this part and is consistent with the eligibility criteria established in this Act.
(7)Manufactured homeThe term manufactured home has the meaning given that term under section 603(6) of the Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5402(6)). (8)Natural solutionsThe term natural solutions means ways of adapting or making property more resilient to climate-driven hazards by making changes that imitate naturally occurring ecological functions that mitigate such hazards.
(9)Resilience and adaptation standardsThe term resilience and adaptation standards means a set of building, landscaping, and construction guidelines for how property owners may preemptively mitigate the impacts of extreme precipitation, flooding, wildfires, heat, and other hazards attributable to global climate change in their dwellings and surrounding non-dwelling property.
