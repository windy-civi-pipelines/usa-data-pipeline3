IV119th CONGRESS1st SessionH. RES. 101IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESFebruary 4, 2025Mrs. Foushee submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Transportation and InfrastructureRESOLUTIONExpressing support for the designation of February 4, 2025, as Transit Equity Day.Whereas Rosa Parks was an iconic figure in the movements for social justice and racial equality and played a major role in the inception of the civil rights movement that ended legal segregation in the United States;Whereas the immediate focus of Rosa Parks historic protest was the unequal access of public transit for African Americans;Whereas unequal access to public transit based on race, income, and disability has persisted to this day and has worsened due to cuts in funding for transportation and consequent fare increases in many transit systems;Whereas paratransit is a necessary component of public transit systems to ensure accessibility for people with disabilities and should be included in any public transit expansions;Whereas affordable, reliable public transit is an essential public service, on par with utilities such as water and electricity;Whereas the increased use of public transit can help address the effects of climate change by reducing automotive pollutants that disproportionately effect communities closest to highways, rural farmlands, and other major roads, which are often communities of color and economically disadvantaged communities; andWhereas many communities across the country celebrate Transit Equity Day on February 4, the birthday of Rosa Parks, by offering fare-free rides on public transportation: Now, therefore, be itThat the House of Representatives—(1)honors the life and legacy of Rosa Parks by nationally recognizing Transit Equity Day;(2)encourages the use of public transportation and the continued work to make public transit accessible for all;(3)applauds transit agencies across the country that offer fare-free rides on Transit Equity Day; and(4)respectfully requests that the Clerk of the House of Representatives transmit an enrolled copy of this resolution to—(A)co-executive directors of the Labor Network for Sustainability, Liz Ratzloff and Joshua Dedmond; and(B)convener of the National Campaign for Transit Justice, LeeAnn Hall.
