Section 2:
2.Findings and purposes 
(a)FindingsThe Congress finds that— (1)the United States has a history of catastrophic natural disasters, including hurricanes, tornadoes, flood, fire, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions; 
(2)although catastrophic natural disasters occur infrequently, their costs are likely to escalate in the coming years, in part because of the intensifying impacts of climate change, coastal development patterns, and increasing property values along the hurricane-prone or earthquake-vulnerable coastlines of the United States; (3)such disasters present physical risk to assets, publicly traded securities, private investments, and companies; 
(4)as the risk of catastrophe losses grows, so do the risks that any premiums collected by private insurers for extending coverage will be insufficient to cover future catastrophes, and private insurers, to protect their shareholders and policyholders (in the case of mutually owned companies), have thus significantly raised premiums and curtailed insurance coverage in States exposed to major catastrophes; (5)such effects on the insurance industry have been harmful to economic activity in States exposed to major catastrophes and have placed significant burdens on residents of such States and the Federal Government; and 
(6) under the current disaster risk management system, the Federal Government and, hence, taxpayers pay for rebuilding through government grants and low-interest loans. (b)PurposesThe purposes of this Act are to establish a program to provide Federal support for State-sponsored insurance programs to help homeowners prepare for and recover from the damages caused by natural catastrophes, to encourage mitigation and prevention for such catastrophes, to promote the use of private market capital as a means to insure against such catastrophes, to expedite the payment of claims and better assist in the financial recovery from such catastrophes.

Section 3:
101.Establishment; chairperson; membership; bylaws 
(a)EstablishmentThere is established an entity to be known as the National Catastrophe Risk Consortium (in this title referred to as the Consortium). (b)ChairpersonThe Secretary of the Treasury, or the designee of the Secretary, shall serve as the chairperson of the Consortium. 
(c)MembershipAny State shall be eligible to participate in the Consortium. (d)ConsiderationsIn selecting members of the Consortium, the States shall— 
(1)select members who have a background and expertise relevant to the functions of the Consortium; and (2)ensure the participation of one individual or representative of an organization that represents consumers, minorities, and low- and moderate-income housing persons by reflecting the communities that are being affected by catastrophic natural disasters. 
(e)BylawsThe Consortium may prescribe, amend, and repeal such bylaws as necessary to carry out the functions of the Consortium.

Section 4:
102.FunctionsThe Consortium shall— 
(1)work with States to gather and maintain an inventory of catastrophe risk obligations held by providers of natural catastrophe insurance; (2)assess issues or gaps in the insurance sector of the United States financial system and any related effects on insurance affordability for policyholders; 
(3)advance consistent, clear, intelligible, comparable, and accurate disclosure of catastrophic risk; (4)submit annual reports to the Congress describing the activities of the Consortium for the preceding year, and the first such annual report shall include an assessment of the costs to States and the regions associated with catastrophe risk; 
(5)assess the potential for major disruptions of private insurance coverage in United States markets particularly vulnerable to catastrophes; (6)make such other recommendations on how identified financial risk can be mitigated, including through new or revised regulatory standards, as appropriate; and 
(7)account for and identify disparate impacts of catastrophic risks on disadvantaged communities and communities of color.

Section 5:
103.Authorization of appropriationsThere are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this title such sums as may be necessary for each of fiscal years 2026 through 2029.

Section 6:
201.PurposesThe purposes of this title are to establish a program— (1)to promote the availability of private capital to provide liquidity and capacity to State catastrophe insurance programs; and 
(2)to expedite the payment of claims under State catastrophe insurance programs and better assist the financial recovery from significant natural catastrophes by authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to guarantee debt for such purposes.

Section 7:
202.Establishment of debt guarantee program (a)Authority of SecretaryThe Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and shall have the powers and authorities necessary to guarantee, and to enter into commitments to guarantee, holders of debt against loss of principal or interest, or both, on any such debt issued by eligible State programs for purposes of this title, provided that the total principal amount of debt obligations guaranteed by the Secretary— 
(1)for eligible State programs that cover earthquake peril shall not exceed $3,500,000,000; and (2)for eligible State programs that cover all other perils shall not exceed $17,000,000,000. 
(b)Conditions for guarantee eligibilityA debt guarantee under this section may be made only if the Secretary has issued a commitment to guarantee to an eligible State program. The commitment to guarantee shall be for a period of 3 years and may be extended by the Secretary for a period of 1 year on each annual anniversary of the issuance of the commitment to guarantee. The commitment to guarantee and each extension of such commitment may be issued by the Secretary only if the following requirements are satisfied: (1)The eligible State program submits to the Secretary a report setting forth, in such form and including such information as the Secretary shall require, how the eligible State program plans to repay the debt. 
(2)Based upon the eligible State program's report submitted pursuant to paragraph (1), the Secretary determines there is reasonable assurance that the eligible State program can meet its repayment obligation under the debt. (3)The eligible State program enters into an agreement with the Secretary, as the Secretary shall require, that the eligible State program will not use Federal funds of any kind or from any Federal source (including any disaster or other financial assistance, loan proceeds, and any other assistance or subsidy) to repay the debt. 
(4)The commitment to guarantee shall specify the fees for debt guarantee coverage. (5)The maximum term of the debt that shall be specified in a commitment issued under this section may not exceed 30 years. 
(6)The Secretary determines that the eligible State program does not cover losses arising from floods to properties that are required to be covered by flood insurance, covered by flood insurance, or located in areas having special flood hazards (as such term is defined for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 and the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973).  (c)Mandatory assistance for eligible State programsThe Secretary shall upon the request of an eligible State program and pursuant to a commitment to guarantee issued under subsection (b), provide a guarantee under subsection (d) for such eligible State program in the amount requested by such eligible State program, subject to the limitation under subsection (d)(2). 
(d)Catastrophic debt guaranteeA debt guarantee under this subsection for an eligible State program shall be subject to the following requirements: (1)PreconditionsThe eligible State program shows to the satisfaction of the Secretary that insured losses in the State to the eligible State program arising from the event or events covered by the commitment to guarantee are likely to exceed the eligible State program’s available cash resources, as of immediately before the date of the event. 
(2)AmountThe aggregate principal amount of the debt guaranteed following an event or events referred to in paragraph (1) may not exceed the amount by which the insured losses expected to be sustained by the State program as a result of such event or events exceed 80 percent of the qualifying assets of the eligible State program as stated in the most recent quarterly financial statement filed with the domiciliary regulator of the program prior to the event or events, except that, for eligible State programs that are not required to file such quarterly financial statements, the aggregate principal amount of the debt guaranteed may not exceed the amount by which insured losses sustained by the State program as a result of such event or events exceed 80 percent of the unrestricted net assets as stated in the annual financial statement for the program’s fiscal year ending immediately prior to the event or events. (3)Use of fundsAmounts of debt guaranteed under this section shall be used only to pay the costs of issuing debt and to pay the insured losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred by an eligible State program. Such amounts shall not be used for any other purpose. 
(e)FundingThere are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out this section.

Section 8:
203.Effect of guaranteeThe issuance of any guarantee by the Secretary under this title shall be conclusive evidence that—

(3)the guarantee is valid, legal, and enforceable.

Section 9:
204.Full faith and creditThe full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to the payment of all guarantees issued under this title with respect to principal and interest.

Section 10:
205.Fees for guarantees; amount; collectionThe Secretary shall charge and collect fees for each guarantee in amounts specified in the commitment to guarantee, which shall be in amounts sufficient in the judgment of the Secretary at the time of issuance of the commitment to guarantee to cover applicable administrative costs and probable losses on the guaranteed obligations covered by the commitment to guarantee, but in any event not to exceed one-half of 1 percent per annum of the outstanding indebtedness covered by each guarantee.

Section 11:
206.Payment of losses (a)In generalThe Secretary agrees to pay to the duly appointed paying agent or trustee (in this section referred to as the Fiscal Agent) for the eligible State program that portion of the principal and interest on any debt guaranteed under this title that shall become due for payment but shall be unpaid by the eligible State program as a result of such program having provided insufficient funds to the Fiscal Agent to make such payments. The Secretary shall make such payments on the date such principal or interest becomes due for payment or on the business day next following the day on which the Secretary shall receive notice of failure on the part of the eligible State program to provide sufficient funds to the Fiscal Agent to make such payments, whichever is later. Upon making such payment, the Secretary shall be subrogated to all the rights of the ultimate recipient of the payment. The Secretary shall be entitled to recover from the eligible State program the amount of any payments made pursuant to any guarantee entered into under this title. 
(b)Role of the Attorney GeneralThe Attorney General shall take such action as may be appropriate to enforce any right accruing to the United States as a result of the issuance of any guarantee under this title. (c)Right of the SecretaryNotwithstanding any other provision of law relating to the acquisition, handling, or disposal of property by the United States, the Secretary shall have the right in the discretion of the Secretary to complete, recondition, reconstruct, renovate, repair, maintain, operate, or sell any property acquired by the Secretary pursuant to the provisions of this title.

The Secretary shall consider the catastrophic insurance and reinsurance market for commercial residential properties, and specifically the availability of adequate private insurance coverage when an insured event occurs, the impact any such capacity restrictions have on housing affordability for renters, and the likelihood that such an expansion of the program would increase insurance capacity for this market segment.

Section 23:
503.Study of risk-based pricing and State program ratesThe Comptroller General of the United States shall conduct a study to analyze— 
(1)risk-based rate pricing, to determine the use of actuarially sound pricing for State insurance, reinsurance, or residual market programs, including what measures States are taking to implement actuarially sound rates; (2)rates for State insurance, reinsurance, or residual market programs that fail to cover the expected value of all future costs, including the cost of capital, associated with insurance policies or reinsurance contracts written by such programs or fail to have sufficient assets above their indebtedness to meet their obligations; and
