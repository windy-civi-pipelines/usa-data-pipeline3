IV119th CONGRESS1st SessionH. RES. 461IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESJune 3, 2025Mr. Issa (for himself, Mr. Kiley of California, Mr. Obernolte, Mr. LaMalfa, Mr. Kean, Mrs. Miller of Illinois, Mrs. Harshbarger, and Mr. Carter of Georgia) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Education and WorkforceRESOLUTIONRecognizing the contributions of independent workers and contractors
            to the American economy. 
Whereas independent workers can be defined as workers who are self-employed, independent contractors, sole proprietors, or nonpermanent workers who are hired on a per-project basis; Whereas independent workers can include, but are not limited to, musicians, lawyers, drivers, couriers, computer programmers, writers, and other entrepreneurs; 
Whereas embracing independent work offers workers great freedom and flexibility in their hours, locations, and occupations; Whereas technological innovation has enabled more Americans than ever to pursue flexible, independent work, including through app-based platforms; 
Whereas 61 percent of independent workers report their earnings are equal or more than with a more traditional work environment; Whereas in 2024, 4,700,000 full-time independent workers earned over $100,000; 
Whereas the flexible work economy offers business owners advantages, such as the ability to hire experts for services not regularly needed or extra workers for busy seasons and lower space costs; Whereas in 2024, roughly 73,000,000 Americans engaged in some type of freelance work, which is an increase of nearly 1,000,000 independent workers from 2023; 
Whereas independent workers contributed $1.5 trillion to the United States economy in 2024; Whereas the number of independent workers has grown exponentially in recent years, with approximately 28,000,000 Americans’ primary income deriving from the independent work economy; 
Whereas according to data from 2024, 52 percent of those aged 18 to 26 and nearly 40 percent of those aged 27 to 42 chose the flexible work economy over traditional employment; Whereas by 2027, an estimated 86,000,000 Americans are projected to participate in the flexible work economy; 
Whereas some elected officials and communities have taken actions to end the independent work economy by supporting legislation that would require freelance workers to register as traditional employees, removing their freedom and flexibility to work where, when, and how they want; and Whereas legislation forcing independent workers to classify as employees could supersede State laws such as Prop 22 in California, which overturned worker classification laws and strengthened contractor freedom: Now, therefore, be it 
That the House of Representatives— (1)recognizes the rising importance of independent workers, app-based earners, freelancers, and other independent contractors to the American economy; and
(2)recognizes the benefits of independent work to entrepreneurs and individuals seeking flexible hours, locations, and occupations and the benefit of additional income-earning potential.
