Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the United States Reciprocal Trade Act.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following: 
(1)The United States maintains an open market for goods, with relatively low tariffs, and has long encouraged trading partners, both bilaterally and in multilateral fora, to liberalize their markets. (2)The United States is the world’s largest importer of goods. 
(3)Trading partners of the United States in many instances impose significantly higher tariffs on United States goods than the United States imposes on the same or similar goods imported from those same countries. (4)Europeans have continued to protect their auto markets from United States automotive companies through high tariffs while dumping cheap European cars into the United States, undermining our automotive industry.
(5)Canadian and Mexican authorities have flooded American markets with cheap goods while simultaneously allowing for illegal migrants and poisonous fentanyl to pour into the United States. (6)United States trading partners in many instances impose significant nontariff barriers that greatly undermine the value of negotiated tariff concessions. 
(7)The lack of reciprocity in tariff levels and disproportionate use of nontariff barriers by United States trading partners facilitates foreign imports, discourages United States exports, and puts United States producers, farmers, and workers at a competitive disadvantage. (8)The lack of reciprocity in tariff levels and nontariff barriers contributes to the large and growing United States trade deficit in goods, which is a drag on economic growth and undermines economic prosperity.
(9)Tariffs under the Trump presidency substantially shrank the trade deficit with China. (10)The President must be able to levy tariffs on our global competitors. Preferential treatment of adversaries, such as China’s Most Favored Nation trading status, undermines American national security interests domestically and around the world. 
(11)To date a number of United States trading partners have been unwilling, including in multilateral negotiations, to reduce tariffs and eliminate nontariff barriers applied to United States exports. (12)The United States should seek action by United States trading partners to lower tariffs and eliminate nontariff barriers, to promote efficiency in those markets and enhance opportunities for United States producers, farmers, and workers.
(13)For the United States to maintain its economic dominance globally, the President must have the authority to levy reciprocal tariffs against unfair trading partners. (14)The President should have a wide array of tools to open the markets of United States trading partners and encourage participation in negotiations to liberalize trade in goods on a fair and reciprocal basis, including the authority to adjust tariff rates to reciprocal levels.

Section 3:
3.Authority to take certain actions relating to reciprocal trade 
(a)In generalIf the President determines that— (1)the rate of duty imposed by a foreign country with respect to a particular good, when imported from the United States, is significantly higher than the rate of duty imposed by the United States on that good, when imported from that country, or 
(2)the nontariff barriers applied by a foreign country with respect to a particular good, when imported from the United States, impose significantly higher burdens, alone or in combination with any tariffs imposed by that country on that good, than the burdens of the nontariff barriers applied by the United States with respect to that good, alone or in combination with any tariffs imposed by the United States on that good, when imported from that country,the President may take one or more of the actions authorized under subsection (b). (b)Actions authorizedThe actions authorized under this subsection are the following: 
(1)To negotiate and seek to enter into an agreement with the foreign country that commits the country to reduce the rate of duty or reduce or eliminate nontariff barriers on the good that is the subject of the determination under subsection (a). (2)To impose a rate of duty on imports of the good that is equal to— 
(A)the rate of duty imposed by the foreign country with respect to the good, in the case of a determination described in subsection (a)(1); or (B)the effective rate of duty of the nontariff barriers applied by the foreign country with respect to the good, alone or in combination with any tariffs imposed by that country on that good, in the case of a determination described in subsection (a)(2). 
(c)FactorsIn taking an action authorized under subsection (b), the President shall consider the following factors: (1)The tariff classification of the good by the United States and the tariff classification of the good by the foreign country.

(4)The end uses and existence of a competitive relationship between the good— (A)as exported from the United States to the foreign country; and 
(B)as imported from the country to the United States. (5)The level of exports of the good by the country to the United States and to other countries. 
(6)In the case of a determination described in subsection (a)(1), the extent to which the rate of duty applied by the foreign country with respect to the good is impeding or distorting trade. (7)In the case of a determination described in subsection (a)(2)— 
(A)the extent of the nontariff barriers applied by the foreign country with respect to the good and the extent of the nontariff barriers applied by the United States with respect to the good; (B)the extent to which the nontariff barriers applied by the country with respect to the good, alone or in combination with any tariffs imposed by that country on that good, are impeding or distorting trade; 
(C)the identified purpose of the nontariff barriers applied by the country with respect to the good, if any, and the extent to which the nontariff barriers are more restrictive than necessary to meet that purpose; and (D)the degree of transparency of the process by which the country adopted the nontariff barriers. 
(8)Other factors, as the President determines appropriate. (d)Role of USTRThe United States Trade Representative, in consultation with the Secretary of Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, and the heads of other relevant Federal agencies, shall advise the President in determining the effective rate of duty imposed by the nontariff barriers applied by a foreign country with respect to a good, alone or in combination with any tariffs imposed by that country on that good, in the case of a determination described in subsection (a)(2). 
(e)Lower rate of dutyThe President may impose a rate of duty on imports of a good from a foreign country that is lower than the rate of duty described in subsection (b)(2)(A) or lower than the effective rate of duty described in subsection (b)(2)(B), as the case may be, if the President determines that application of such lower rate of duty is necessary and appropriate. (f)Higher rate of dutyIf the President imposes a rate of duty on imports of a good from a foreign country under subsection (b)(2), and the country further increases its rate of duty on imports of the good from the United States, the President may further increase the rate of duty on imports of the good from the country to a rate that is equal to the rate of duty applied by that country. 
(g)TerminationThe President shall terminate the imposition of any increase in the rate of duty on imports of a good from a foreign country under subsection (b)(2) effective on the date on which the President determines that— (1)the foreign country is no longer— 
(A)imposing a rate of duty with respect to the good, as described in subsection (a)(1); or (B)applying nontariff barriers with respect to the good, as described in subsection (a)(2); or
