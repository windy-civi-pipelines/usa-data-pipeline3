Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Cerebral Palsy Research Program Authorization Act of 2025.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following: 
(1)Cerebral palsy is the most common lifelong motor impairment in children, affecting more than 1,000,000 Americans, 1 in 345 children, and over 17,000,000 people worldwide. (2)In the United States, more than 10,000 babies are diagnosed with cerebral palsy each year. 
(3)Cerebral palsy is a broad group of disorders disrupting a person’s ability to move, sit, stand, walk, talk, and use their hands. (4)In more than 80 percent of cases, the cause of cerebral palsy is unknown. 
(5)Seventy-five percent of individuals with cerebral palsy also have 1 or more additional developmental disabilities including epilepsy, intellectual disabilities, communication problems, learning and attention disorders, chronic pain, autism, hearing disorders, and visual impairments or blindness. (6)Children with cerebral palsy are more likely to die from the flu and related viruses, including COVID–19, than children without neurologic disorders. 
(7)There is no consensus of best practices for a person with cerebral palsy at the time of diagnosis or through the lifespan. (8)It is estimated that the lifetime care and medical costs for all people with cerebral palsy who were born in 2000 alone will total more than $13,500,000,000. The loss of productivity and lost wages of the individual with cerebral palsy and their family members is more than $35,000,000,000. 
(9)Although there is not yet a known cure for many types of cerebral palsy, we know that treatment breakthroughs and the prevention of many types of cerebral palsy is possible.
