Such regulations shall—(A)using the best available science, including the 2023 Wildfire Hazard Potential map produced by the Forest Service Fire Modeling Institute and the 2023 Vegetation Condition Class categorization produced by the Landscape Fire and Resource Management Planning Tools program, identify firesheds with significant wildfire hazard potential and vegetation departure from a fire-adapted historical baseline from which qualified forest residue biomass can be sourced;(B)identify regional and ecosystem-specific requirements to limit eligibility to practices and sites which—(i)have minimal negative impacts on soil quality, soil fertility, soil erosion, soil carbon sequestration, and site productivity;(ii)have minimal negative impacts on biodiversity, including soil microbiota, plants, and animals;(iii)have minimal negative impacts on water quality and hydrological functioning;(iv)have minimal impacts on reducing or displacing food production; and(v)have minimal substitution for existing economic uses of forest products, including considering reducing the maximum diameter of thinned trees considered to be qualified forest residue biomass; and(C)consider direct and indirect impacts of biomass sourcing and harvest.(2)Public comment requirementNot later than 6 months after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall publish in the Federal Register proposed regulations that include sustainability standards for the forest residue carbon removal and storage tax credit.(3)Public comment period(A)DurationThe Secretary shall provide for a period of not less than 60 days after the date of publication of the proposed regulations during which the public may submit comments on the proposed regulations.(B)Consideration of commentsThe Secretary shall consider all comments received during the public comment period before issuing final regulations.(4)Final regulationsThe Secretary shall issue final regulations and establish sustainability standards for the carbon removal tax credit established under this section not later than 90 days after the close of the public comment period, taking into account feedback from the public and stakeholders.(5)Consideration of revisionEvery 5 years, the Secretary shall provide for a public comment period to consider whether the sustainability standards should be updated to reflect latest science.
