Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Use Sovereignty To reduce Rx Act or the USTRx Act.

Section 2:
2.Findings; sense of Congress (a)FindingsCongress finds the following: 
(1)Pharmaceutical price controls in foreign markets distort global trade flows and competition by depressing the prices of innovative drugs and exploiting pharmaceutical innovations researched and developed in the United States. (2)By setting prices at levels that are not market-based, such price controls undervalue the discovery of new, innovative treatments, diminish opportunities and incentives for global innovation in new medicines, and threaten to restrict access to new treatments and cures for United States patients and consumers. 
(3)Recognizing these dynamics, it is critical that the United States use all available trade tools to address such free-riding to ensure that foreign government regulatory reimbursement regimes are transparent, provide procedural fairness, are non-discriminatory, and provide full market access to United States products. (b)Sense of CongressIt is the sense of Congress that— 
(1)ensuring the security of innovative and affordable healthcare is a top priority for Americans and for Congress; (2)foreign government policies that mandate artificially low drug prices in foreign markets undermine this priority by reducing global incentives to invest in the development of new medicines; 
(3)such exploitative behavior unfairly shifts the cost of developing new treatments to the United States and unduly relies on America’s patients and taxpayers to finance global pharmaceutical innovation; and (4)safeguarding access to life-saving treatments for American patients requires combating such behavior so that foreign countries pay their fair share of the costs associated with the development of new drugs.
