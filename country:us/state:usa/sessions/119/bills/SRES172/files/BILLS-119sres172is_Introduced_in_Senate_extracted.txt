Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), impacts Black women and birthing people’s right to reproductive health care and bodily autonomy and further perpetuates reproductive oppression as a tool to control women’s bodies;Whereas a fair and wide distribution of economic resources and birth options, especially regarding reproductive health care services and maternal health programming, including prenatal, postpartum, family planning, and education programs, is critical to addressing inequities in maternal health outcomes;Whereas communities of color are disproportionately affected by maternity care deserts, where there are no or limited hospitals or birth centers offering obstetric care and no or limited obstetric providers, and have diminishing access to reproductive health care due to low Medicaid reimbursements, rising costs, and ongoing staff shortages;Whereas Black midwives, doulas, perinatal health workers, and community-based organizations provide holistic maternal health care, but face systemic, structural, economic, and legal barriers to licensure, reimbursement, and provision of care;Whereas Black women and birthing people experience increased structural and financial barriers to accessing prenatal and postpartum care, including maternal mental health care;Whereas COVID–19, which has disproportionately harmed Black Americans, is associated with an increased risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes and maternal and neonatal complications;Whereas new data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has indicated that since the COVID–19 pandemic, the maternal mortality rate for Black women has increased by 26 percent;Whereas Black pregnant women have historically low rates of vaccinations, which is associated with higher disparities in maternal health outcomes;Whereas, even as there is growing concern about improving access to mental health services, Black women are least likely to have access to mental health screenings, treatment, and support before, during, and after pregnancy;Whereas Black pregnant and postpartum workers are disproportionately denied reasonable accommodations in the workplace, leading to adverse pregnancy outcomes;Whereas Black pregnant people disproportionately experience surveillance and punishment, including shackling incarcerated people in labor, drug testing mothers and infants without informed consent, separating mothers from their newborns, and criminalizing pregnancy outcomes such as miscarriage;Whereas Black women and birthing people experience pervasive racial injustice in the criminal justice, social, and health care systems;Whereas justice-informed, culturally congruent models of care are beneficial to Black women; andWhereas an investment must be made in—(1)maternity care for Black women and birthing people, including care led by the communities most affected by the maternal health crisis in the United States;(2)continuous health insurance coverage to support Black women and birthing people for the full postpartum period at least 1 year after giving birth; and(3)policies that support and promote affordable, comprehensive, and holistic maternal health care that is free from gender and racial discrimination, regardless of incarceration: Now, therefore, be itThat the Senate recognizes that—(1)Black women are experiencing high, disproportionate rates of maternal mortality and morbidity in the United States;(2)the alarmingly high rates of maternal mortality among Black women are unacceptable and unjust;(3)in order to better mitigate the effects of systemic and structural racism, Congress must work toward ensuring that the Black community has—(A)safe and affordable housing;(B)transportation equity;(C)nutritious food;(D)clean air and water;(E)environments free from toxins;(F)decriminalization, removal of civil penalties, end of surveillance, and end of mandatory reporting within the criminal and family regulation system;(G)safety and freedom from violence, especially violence perpetrated by government actors;(H)a living wage;(I)equal economic opportunity;(J)a sustained and expansive workforce pipeline for diverse perinatal professionals;
