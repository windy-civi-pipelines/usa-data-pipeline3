Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the World Language Education Assistance Program Act or the World LEAP Act.

Section 2:
2.PurposeThe purpose of this Act is to establish and make assistance available to the World Language Education Assistance Program in order to—(1)establish or improve and carry out World Language Education Assistance Program grant programs;(2)support and uplift dual language and world language programs; and(3)provide students with the language skills necessary for an interconnected and global world.

Section 3:
3.FindingsCongress finds the following:(1)Recent academic studies demonstrate that America’s language capacity has reached a crisis point, with only one fifth of United States residents speaking a language other than English at home, 90 percent of United States-based employers reporting a reliance on employees with language skills other than English, and one third of foreign language-dependent employers reporting a language skills gap. This language crisis has real world implications for business, government, the military, and diplomatic and intelligence services.(2)The Department of Education does not have an innovative world languages program for elementary and secondary students.(3)The Nation’s education system is suffering from severe shortages of world language, English learner, and bilingual and dual language immersion educators.(4)The lack of a Federal elementary and secondary school world language and dual language program, coupled with the continuing shortage of world language and bilingual teachers, creates significant obstacles to providing equitable opportunities for all students to develop multilingualism. English learners, a population which has grown by 2,100,000 between 2000 and 2019, have been disproportionately impacted.(5)The Federal Government has a strong interest in better preparing American students to compete in the global economy.
