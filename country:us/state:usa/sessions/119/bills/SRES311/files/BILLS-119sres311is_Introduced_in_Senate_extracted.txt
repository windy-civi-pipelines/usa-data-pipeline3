        III
        119th CONGRESS
        1st Session
        S. RES. 311
        IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
        
            June 26 (legislative day, June 24),
                2025
            Mr. Marshall (for himself, Mr. Tuberville, and Mrs.
                    Blackburn) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to
                the Committee on Rules and
                    Administration
        
        RESOLUTION
        Expressing the sense of the Senate that the Parliamentarian of
            the Senate should serve not more than 1 term of 6 years.
    
    
        
 Whereas the Parliamentarian of the Senate serves at the will of the Secretary of the Senate, who is chosen by the majority leader;
        
        
 Whereas the Parliamentarian of the Senate advises the presiding officer on rules, procedures, and precedents;
        
        
 Whereas, since 1981, only 3 individuals have served as Parliamentarian of the Senate, serving an average of 15 years;
        
        
 Whereas, in 2001, the Secretary of the Senate dismissed the Parliamentarian of the Senate; and
        
        
 Whereas a 6-year term limit for the Parliamentarian of the Senate would prevent entrenchment of power, promote accountability, and encourage fresh perspectives: Now, therefore, be it
        
    
    
        
 That the Senate—  (1) acknowledges that the Parliamentarian of the Senate serves at the pleasure of the Secretary of the Senate, who is chosen by the majority leader of the Senate;
            
            
                (2)
 recognizes that historical precedent allows the Secretary of the Senate to dismiss the Parliamentarian of the Senate;
            
            
                (3)
 remains committed to using the reconciliation process to return the United States to sound fiscal footing by removing waste, fraud, and abuse from mandatory spending programs; and
            
            
                (4)
 believes that the Parliamentarian of the Senate should serve not more than 1 term of 6 years.
