Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Paycheck Fairness Act.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following:(1)Women have entered the workforce in record numbers over the past 50 years.(2)Despite the enactment of the Equal Pay Act of 1963 (Public Law 88–38), many women continue to earn significantly lower pay than men for equal work. These pay disparities exist in both the private and governmental sectors. Pay disparities are especially severe for women and girls of color. (3)In many instances, the pay disparities can only be due to continued intentional discrimination or the lingering effects of past discrimination. After controlling for educational attainment, occupation, industry, union status, race, ethnicity, and labor force experience roughly 40 percent of the pay gap remains unexplained. (4)The existence of such pay disparities—(A)depresses the wages of working families who rely on the wages of all members of the family to make ends meet;(B)undermines women's retirement security, which is often based on earnings while in the workforce;(C)prevents women from realizing their full economic potential, particularly in terms of labor force participation and attachment;(D)has been spread and perpetuated, through commerce and the channels and instrumentalities of commerce, among the workers of the several States;(E)burdens commerce and the free flow of goods in commerce;(F)constitutes an unfair method of competition in commerce;(G)tends to cause labor disputes, as evidenced by the tens of thousands of charges filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission against employers between 2010 and 2016;(H)interferes with the orderly and fair marketing of goods in commerce; and(I)in many instances, may deprive workers of equal protection on the basis of sex in violation of the Fifth and 14th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.(5)(A)Artificial barriers to the elimination of discrimination in the payment of wages on the basis of sex continue to exist decades after the enactment of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 201 et seq.) and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000a et seq.).(B)These barriers have resulted, in significant part, because the Equal Pay Act of 1963 has not worked as Congress originally intended. Improvements and modifications to the law are necessary to ensure that the Act provides effective protection to those subject to pay discrimination on the basis of their sex.(C)Elimination of such barriers would have positive effects, including—(i)providing a solution to problems in the economy created by unfair pay disparities;(ii)substantially reducing the number of working women earning unfairly low wages, thereby reducing the dependence on public assistance;(iii)promoting stable families by enabling all family members to earn a fair rate of pay;(iv)remedying the effects of past discrimination on the basis of sex and ensuring that in the future workers are afforded equal protection on the basis of sex; and(v)ensuring equal protection pursuant to Congress’ power to enforce the Fifth and 14th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.(6)The Department of Labor and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission carry out functions to help ensure that women receive equal pay for equal work.(7)The Department of Labor is responsible for—(A)collecting and making publicly available information about women’s pay;(B)disseminating information about women’s rights in the workplace;(C)helping women who have been victims of pay discrimination obtain a remedy; and(D)investigating and prosecuting systemic gender based pay discrimination involving government contractors.(8)The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is the primary enforcement agency for claims made under the Equal Pay Act of 1963, and issues regulations and guidance on appropriate interpretations of the law.(9) Vigorous implementation by the Department of Labor and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, increased information as a result of the amendments made by this Act, wage data, and more effective remedies, will ensure that women are better able to recognize and enforce their rights.(10)Certain employers have already made great strides in eradicating unfair pay disparities in the workplace and their achievements should be recognized.

Section 3:

These pay disparities exist in both the private and governmental sectors. Pay disparities are especially severe for women and girls of color. (3)In many instances, the pay disparities can only be due to continued intentional discrimination or the lingering effects of past discrimination. After controlling for educational attainment, occupation, industry, union status, race, ethnicity, and labor force experience roughly 40 percent of the pay gap remains unexplained. (4)The existence of such pay disparities—(A)depresses the wages of working families who rely on the wages of all members of the family to make ends meet;(B)undermines women's retirement security, which is often based on earnings while in the workforce;(C)prevents women from realizing their full economic potential, particularly in terms of labor force participation and attachment;(D)has been spread and perpetuated, through commerce and the channels and instrumentalities of commerce, among the workers of the several States;(E)burdens commerce and the free flow of goods in commerce;(F)constitutes an unfair method of competition in commerce;(G)tends to cause labor disputes, as evidenced by the tens of thousands of charges filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission against employers between 2010 and 2016;(H)interferes with the orderly and fair marketing of goods in commerce; and(I)in many instances, may deprive workers of equal protection on the basis of sex in violation of the Fifth and 14th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.(5)(A)Artificial barriers to the elimination of discrimination in the payment of wages on the basis of sex continue to exist decades after the enactment of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 201 et seq.) and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000a et seq.).(B)These barriers have resulted, in significant part, because the Equal Pay Act of 1963 has not worked as Congress originally intended. Improvements and modifications to the law are necessary to ensure that the Act provides effective protection to those subject to pay discrimination on the basis of their sex.(C)Elimination of such barriers would have positive effects, including—(i)providing a solution to problems in the economy created by unfair pay disparities;(ii)substantially reducing the number of working women earning unfairly low wages, thereby reducing the dependence on public assistance;(iii)promoting stable families by enabling all family members to earn a fair rate of pay;(iv)remedying the effects of past discrimination on the basis of sex and ensuring that in the future workers are afforded equal protection on the basis of sex; and(v)ensuring equal protection pursuant to Congress’ power to enforce the Fifth and 14th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.(6)The Department of Labor and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission carry out functions to help ensure that women receive equal pay for equal work.(7)The Department of Labor is responsible for—(A)collecting and making publicly available information about women’s pay;(B)disseminating information about women’s rights in the workplace;(C)helping women who have been victims of pay discrimination obtain a remedy; and(D)investigating and prosecuting systemic gender based pay discrimination involving government contractors.(8)The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is the primary enforcement agency for claims made under the Equal Pay Act of 1963, and issues regulations and guidance on appropriate interpretations of the law.(9) Vigorous implementation by the Department of Labor and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, increased information as a result of the amendments made by this Act, wage data, and more effective remedies, will ensure that women are better able to recognize and enforce their rights.(10)Certain employers have already made great strides in eradicating unfair pay disparities in the workplace and their achievements should be recognized.3.Enhanced enforcement of equal pay requirements(a)Bona Fide factor defense and modification of same establishment requirementSection 6(d)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 206(d)(1)) is amended—(1)by striking No employer having and inserting (A) No employer having;(2)by striking any other factor other than sex and inserting a bona fide factor other than sex, such as education, training, or experience; and(3)by adding at the end the following:(B)The bona fide factor defense described in subparagraph (A)(iv) shall apply only if the employer demonstrates that such factor (i) is not based upon or derived from a sex-based differential in compensation; (ii) is job-related with respect to the position in question; (iii) is consistent with business necessity; and (iv) accounts for the entire differential in compensation at issue. Such defense shall not apply where the employee demonstrates that an alternative employment practice exists that would serve the same business purpose without producing such differential and that the employer has refused to adopt such alternative practice.(C)For purposes of subparagraph (A), employees shall be deemed to work in the same establishment if the employees work for the same employer at workplaces located in the same county or similar political subdivision of a State. The preceding sentence shall not be construed as limiting broader applications of the term establishment consistent with rules prescribed or guidance issued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission..(b)Nonretaliation provisionSection 15 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 215) is amended—(1)in subsection (a)—(A)in paragraph (3), by striking employee has filed and all that follows and insertingemployee—(A)has made a charge or filed any complaint or instituted or caused to be instituted any investigation, proceeding, hearing, or action under or related to this Act, including an investigation conducted by the employer, or has testified or is planning to testify or has assisted or participated in any manner in any such investigation, proceeding, hearing or action, or has served or is planning to serve on an industry committee; or(B)has inquired about, discussed, or disclosed the wages of the employee or another employee (such as by inquiring or discussing with the employer why the wages of the employee involved are set at a certain rate or salary);; (B)in paragraph (5), by striking and at the end;(C)in paragraph (6), by striking the period at the end and inserting ; and; and(D)by adding at the end the following:(7)to require an employee to sign a contract or waiver that would prohibit the employee from disclosing information about the employee’s wages.; and(2)by adding at the end the following:(c)Subsection (a)(3)(B) shall not apply to instances in which an employee who has access to the wage information of other employees as a part of such employee’s essential job functions discloses the wages of such other employees to individuals who do not otherwise have access to such information, unless such disclosure is in response to a complaint or charge or in furtherance of an investigation, proceeding, hearing, or action under section 6(d), including an investigation conducted by the employer. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit the rights of an employee provided under any other provision of law..(c)Enhanced penaltiesSection 16(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 216(b)) is amended—(1)by inserting after the first sentence the following: Any employer who violates section 6(d) shall additionally be liable for such compensatory damages, or, if the employee demonstrates that the employer acted with malice or reckless indifference, punitive damages as may be appropriate, except that the United States shall not be liable for punitive damages.;(2)in the sentence beginning An action to, by striking the preceding sentences and inserting any of the preceding sentences of this subsection;(3)in the sentence beginning No employees shall, by striking No employees and inserting Except with respect to class actions brought to enforce section 6(d), no employee;(4)by inserting after the sentence referred to in paragraph (3), the following: Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal law, any action brought to enforce section 6(d) may be maintained as a class action as provided by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.; and(5)in the sentence beginning The court in—(A)by striking in such action and inserting in any action brought to recover the liability prescribed in any of the preceding sentences of this subsection; and(B)by inserting before the period the following: , including expert fees.(d)Action by the SecretarySection 16(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 216(c)) is amended—(1)in the first sentence—(A)by inserting or, in the case of a violation of section 6(d), additional compensatory or punitive damages, as described in subsection (b), before and the agreement; and(B)by inserting before the period the following: , or such compensatory or punitive damages, as appropriate;(2)in the second sentence, by inserting before the period the following: and, in the case of a violation of section 6(d), additional compensatory or punitive damages, as described in subsection (b);(3)in the third sentence, by striking the first sentence and inserting the first or second sentence; and(4)in the sixth sentence—(A)by striking commenced in the case and insertingcommenced—(1)in the case;(B)by striking the period and inserting ; or; and(C)by adding at the end the following:(2)in the case of a class action brought to enforce section 6(d), on the date on which the individual becomes a party plaintiff to the class action..4.TrainingThe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, subject to the availability of funds appropriated under section 11, shall provide training to Commission employees and affected individuals and entities on matters involving discrimination in the payment of wages.5.Negotiation skills training(a)Program authorized(1)In generalThe Secretary of Labor, after consultation with the Secretary of Education, is authorized to establish and carry out a grant program.(2)GrantsIn carrying out the program, the Secretary of Labor may make grants on a competitive basis to eligible entities to carry out negotiation skills training programs for the purposes of addressing pay disparities, including through outreach to women and girls.(3)Eligible entitiesTo be eligible to receive a grant under this subsection, an entity shall be a public agency, such as a State, a local government in a metropolitan statistical area (as defined by the Office of Management and Budget), a State educational agency, or a local educational agency, a private nonprofit organization, or a community-based organization.(4)ApplicationTo be eligible to receive a grant under this subsection, an entity shall submit an application to the Secretary of Labor at such time, in such manner, and containing such information as the Secretary of Labor may require.(5)Use of fundsAn entity that receives a grant under this subsection shall use the funds made available through the grant to carry out an effective negotiation skills training program for the purposes described in paragraph (2).(b)Incorporating training into existing programsThe Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Education shall issue regulations or policy guidance that provides for integrating the negotiation skills training, to the extent practicable, into programs authorized under—(1)in the case of the Secretary of Education, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.), the Carl D.
