Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the William S. Knudsen Defense Remobilization Act.

Section 2:
2.Findings Congress makes the following findings:(1)The United States faces a critical lack of domestic industrial capacity necessary to support and maintain its defense, particularly in the event of a major conflict.(2)Current and building shortages of munitions and materiel are estimated to require years to replenish sufficiently.(3)The domestic industrial base is shaped by Federal Government policies, including by a raft of regulations that often inhibit production and expansion.(4)The lack of industrial capacity now constituted a major threat to the national security as conflicts supplied with United States arms escalate around the globe and imminent threats to United States interests have emerged.(5)Before entering World War II, the United States faced a similar crisis of adequate defense production as it supplied its allies in Europe and prepared for the event of war.(6)In 1940, William S. Knudsen, an American automotive executive, was tasked with coordinating and spearheading the nation’s war production by serving as the chairman of the Office of Production Management and as a member of the National Defense Advisory Commission.(7)As a result of Mr. Knudsen’s efforts, the United States mobilized an unprecedented industrial war production network, renowned as the Arsenal of Democracy, that enabled Allied victory.
