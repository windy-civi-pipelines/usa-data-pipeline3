On July 16, 2014, Ellie Helton, a vibrant, loving 14-year-old from Apex, North Carolina, passed away as a result of a ruptured aneurysm, stunning her parents, two sisters, and many, many loved ones. A day earlier, on her second day of high school, she woke up with a terrible headache after a plum-sized aneurysm on her brain stem ruptured. While she suffered headaches throughout her life, she was never diagnosed. Ellie was an avid reader and excellent student, loved the arts, and was incredibly creative. She had an unwavering, constant love for the family and friends in her life.</text></subparagraph><subparagraph commented="no" id="H26E2820E238A460DB01FC1379EAD79E5"><enum>(B)</enum><text>Lisa Colagrossi. On March 20, 2015, Lisa Colagrossi—WABC Eyewitness News reporter, wife of 17 years, and mother of two sons—unexpectedly passed away at the age of 49 years after suffering a massive ruptured brain aneurysm. Despite experiencing one of the classic warning signs of a brain aneurysm (the <quote>worst headache of my life</quote>), Lisa’s passing came as a tremendous shock to her family and friends, who did not know what a brain aneurysm was, let alone its signs and symptoms. She is remembered for being a loving wife, a mother, and a successful reporter, and for her love of the New York Rangers.</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="H97495435112E4E12B6AC389BA7466153" commented="no"><enum>(C)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Kristen Shafer Englert.

Prior to her passing, she went to the emergency room with symptoms of a brain aneurysm and was sent home without a scan. Kristen was a dedicated teacher who loved children. She was thrilled to become a mother. Sadly, she only experienced motherhood for a few short days. Kristen’s family members have been dedicated advocates since her passing. </text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="HBADEB1EE5F3A4472ADC043C16EFEC215" commented="no"><enum>(D)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Teresa Anne Lawrence.
