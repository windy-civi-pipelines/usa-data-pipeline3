Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Burma Genocide Accountability and Protection Act or the Burma GAP Act.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following:(1)In its report dated September 17, 2018, the United Nations Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar (FFM) found that impunity was a root cause of continued human rights violations in Myanmar that has significantly and demonstrably contributed to the validation of deeply oppressive and discriminatory conduct, enabled recurrence of human rights violations and atrocity crimes, and emboldened perpetrators and silenced victims, and concluded that ensuring accountability for crimes was the key to disrupting patterns of oppression and cycles of violence as well as a legal obligation for Burma.(2)On December 13, 2018, the United States House of Representatives passed H. Res. 1091, by an overwhelming majority of 394 to 1, expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that atrocities committed against Rohingya by members of the Burma military and security forces since August 2017 constitute crimes against humanity and genocide.(3)On September 16, 2019, the FFM reported that it has reasonable grounds to conclude that the evidence that infers genocidal intent on the part of the state, identified in its last report, has strengthened that there is a serious risk that genocidal actions may occur or recur.(4)On February 1, 2021, the Burma military conducted a coup d’état, derailing Burma’s transition to democracy and disregarding the will of the people of Burma.(5)Since the February 2021 military coup, the Burma military and certain local armed groups have continued to commit crimes and abuses against Rohingya. In Rakhine state, over 600,000 Rohingya, including at least 130,000 confined in internally displaced persons (IDP) camps face heightened risks. The military continues to target Rohingya with laws and policies that criminalize the exercise of human rights, as well as with arbitrary arrest and detention, torture, sexual violence, and murder.(6)On March 21, 2022, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced the Secretary had determined that members of the Burmese military committed genocide and crimes against humanity against Rohingya.(7)The United States has been the leading contributor of humanitarian assistance in response to the Rohingya crisis.(8)The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said in a June 2023 report that the Burma military’s restrictions on aid access by local and international organizations seeking to respond to Cyclone Mocha in Rakhine state in May 2023 may amount to gross violations of international human rights law, and serious violations of international humanitarian law.(9)According to the World Food Program, over 15 percent of young children in the Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh are suffering from malnutrition. The World Food Program estimates that it needs another $83,000,000 in funding to maintain full rations and meet the basic minimum nutritional needs of refugees through May 2026.(10)Funding cuts and rising commodity prices have exacerbated protection concerns for Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, especially with respect to gender-based violence and child protection, worsening health outcomes and fueling unsafe and irregular migration throughout the surrounding region.(11)Combined with rising food insecurity, Rohingya are increasingly unsafe in Bangladesh as a result of growing competition between armed and criminal groups in the refugee camps. These factors have driven thousands of Rohingya to flee to maritime Southeast Asia by boat only to face obstacles from regional navies and growing resentment from local populations.(12)The long, systemic denial of the exercise of certain rights, including education, freedoms of expression, movement, and rights related to nationality have had enduring effects on many Rohingya persons’ mental and physical well-being and perpetuate the risk of future genocidal violence until these root causes are addressed.

Section 3:

Section 4:
4.Sense of CongressIt is the sense of Congress that—(1)the United States has a moral and legal responsibility to prevent and punish genocide, including against Rohingya;(2)the Secretary of State’s determination in March 2022 that genocide and crimes against humanity have been committed against Rohingya by members of the Burma military should lead to support for Rohingya to overcome decades of systemic persecution, marginalization, and violence;(3)the Rohingya crisis and the broader Burma crisis must be addressed simultaneously to ensure that history does not repeat itself;(4)the United States should work with other donor nations to ensure that Rohingya refugees in refugee camps in Bangladesh receive a ration sufficient to meet the humanitarian minimum standards for food and nutrition needs;(5)the United States should encourage other countries to contribute additional assistance and follow United States leadership in protecting Rohingya through humanitarian assistance, political and economic empowerment, accountability for genocide, crimes against humanity, and any other international crimes committed by the Burma military and other armed groups in Burma, as well as supporting the voluntary resettlement or eventual safe repatriation of Rohingya refugees to Burma when conditions allow; and(6)the United States should continue not to recognize the Burma military junta as the legitimate political representative of the Burmese people given the genocide, crimes against humanity, and coup that it has perpetrated.
