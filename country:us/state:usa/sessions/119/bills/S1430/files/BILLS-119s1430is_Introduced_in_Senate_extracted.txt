(b)PurposesThe purposes of this section are—(1)to expedite the environmental review process at Federal agencies and for the general public; and (2)to facilitate interactive public stakeholder engagement and understanding of environmental impacts of projects under the Federal-aid highway system.(c)Encouraged use of digital platforms and digital twins(1)In generalThe Secretary shall encourage recipients of Federal funds from the Secretary to utilize interactive, digital, cloud-based platforms and high fidelity, 3-dimensional digital models of infrastructure project elements, such as digital twins, when carrying out environmental reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) by publishing the guidance described in paragraph (2).(2)GuidanceNot later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall publish technology-neutral best practice guidance to encourage sponsors of projects that receive Federal funds from the Secretary to use an interactive, digital, cloud-based platform and high fidelity, 3-dimensional digital models of infrastructure project elements, such as digital twins, in carrying out the environmental impact analysis and community engagement processes required under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.). (d)Use of digital platforms and digital twins in covered projects(1)In generalThe Secretary shall select not less than 10 covered projects to demonstrate the use of interactive, digital, cloud-based platforms and high fidelity, 3-dimensional digital models of infrastructure project elements, such as digital twins, in carrying out the environmental impact analysis and community engagement processes required under that Act, which may include projects in States participating in the surface transportation project delivery program under section 327 of title 23, United States Code.

(3)PriorityNotwithstanding any other provision of law, in selecting covered projects under a program described in subparagraphs (A) through (D) of subsection (a)(1), the Secretary shall give priority to applications for projects that demonstrate a plan to implement an interactive, cloud-based platform and high fidelity, 3-dimensional digital models of infrastructure project elements, such as digital twins, to carry out the environmental impact analysis and community engagement processes required under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.). (e)Reports(1)In generalNot later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives a report on the efficacy of using interactive, cloud-based platforms and high fidelity, 3-dimensional digital models of infrastructure project elements, such as digital twins, in carrying out environmental impact analysis and community engagement requirements under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), including—(A)metrics that describe estimates of achieved efficiencies, community engagement measures, and efficiencies enjoyed across Federal agencies; and(B)examples of digital workflows enabled. (2)Publication of examplesNot later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall publish on the website of the Department of Transportation, and submit to the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives, not less than 5 examples of an environmental impact statement, environmental assessment, or categorical exclusion document developed using an interactive, digital, cloud-based platform and high fidelity, 3-dimensional digital models of infrastructure project elements, such as digital twins. (f)Savings provisionNothing in this section affects or interferes with the authorities or responsibilities assumed by a State under section 327 of title 23, United States Code.
