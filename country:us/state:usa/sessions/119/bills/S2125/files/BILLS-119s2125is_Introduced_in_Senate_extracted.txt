Section 1:
1.
            Short title
 This Act may be cited as the Prying Into Chinese Tyrants' Unreported Riches, Earnings, and Secrets Act or the PICTURES Act.

Section 2:
2.
            Findings
 Congress makes the following findings:  (1) The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) operates as an opaque, authoritarian regime in which political power is concentrated in the hands of a relatively small group of senior officials.
            
            
                (2)
 The leadership of the CCP, including full members of the Central Committee and the Central Committee’s Politburo (also known as the Political Bureau) and Politburo Standing Committee, exert significant control over economic, military, and political affairs both within the People's Republic of China and externally.
            
            
                (3)
 Numerous credible reports and investigations have revealed that senior CCP officials and their families have amassed substantial wealth, often hidden through opaque financial structures, foreign holdings, and proxies.
            
            
                (4)
 A report issued by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) in March 2025 provided an important initial assessment of the financial assets of CCP leaders. A subsequent report, incorporating photographic evidence of CCP leaders’ wealth and corruption, could build upon that work to further expose the hypocrisy and duplicity of the Chinese Communist Party.
            
            
                (5)
 Understanding the financial interests, personal assets, and overseas holdings of CCP leaders is essential to informing United States foreign policy, national security, and economic security decision-making.

Section 3:
3.
            Sense of Congress
 It is the sense of Congress that—  (1) the effectiveness and credibility of intelligence reporting on sensitive subjects, including the wealth of senior CCP officials, depends upon the full cooperation of all relevant components of the United States intelligence community; and
            
            
                (2)
 all related nonpublic information, including classified intelligence, financial data, and foreign partner reporting, must be made available within the United States intelligence community to support such assessments to the fullest extent possible consistent with the protection of sources and methods.

Section 4:
4.
