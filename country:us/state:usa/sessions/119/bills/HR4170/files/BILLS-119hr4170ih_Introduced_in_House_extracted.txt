Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Bridge Corrosion Prevention and Repair Act of 2025.

Section 2:
2.Corrosion prevention for bridges(a)DefinitionsIn this section:(1)Applicable bridge projectThe term applicable bridge project means a project for construction, replacement, rehabilitation, preservation, or protection, other than de minimis work, as determined by the entity carrying out the project, on—(A)a bridge project that receives financial assistance under title 23, United States Code; or(B)a project for a railroad bridge (as defined in section 237.5 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (or successor regulations)) that receives financial assistance under title 49, United States Code. (2)Certified contractorThe term certified contractor means a contracting or subcontracting firm that has been certified by a third-party organization recognized industry-wide that evaluates the capability of the contractor or subcontractor to properly perform 1 or more specified aspects of an applicable bridge project described in subsection (b)(2). (3)Qualified training programThe term qualified training program means a training program in corrosion control, mitigation, and prevention that is—(A)offered by an organization that provides trainees with a certification that meets the ANSI/NACE Number 13/SSPC–ACS–1 standard (or a successor standard) or another standard approved by the Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration; or (B)an industrial coatings applicator training program—(i)registered under the Act of August 16, 1937 (commonly known as the National Apprenticeship Act) (50 Stat. 664, chapter 663; 29 U.S.C. 50 et seq.); and(ii)that meets the standards of subpart A of part 29 and part 30 of title 29, Code of Federal Regulations (or successor regulations). (b)Applicable bridge projects(1)Quality controlA certified contractor shall carry out aspects of an applicable bridge project described in paragraph (2).(2)Aspects of applicable bridge projectsAspects of an applicable bridge project referred to in paragraph (1) include—(A)surface preparation or coating application on steel, concrete, or rebar of an applicable bridge project; (B)removal of a lead-based or other hazardous coating from steel or concrete of an existing applicable bridge project; and(C)shop painting of structural steel or rebar fabricated for installation on an applicable bridge project. (3)Corrosion management systemIn carrying out an applicable bridge project, the entity carrying out the project shall—(A)implement a corrosion management system that utilizes industry-recognized standards and corrosion mitigation and prevention methods to address different considerations, including—(i)surface preparation;(ii)protective coatings; (iii)materials selection;(iv)cathodic protection; (v)corrosion engineering; (vi)personnel training; and (vii)best practices in environmental protection to prevent environmental degradation and uphold public health; and (B)require certified contractors, for the purpose of carrying out aspects of applicable bridge projects described in paragraph (2), to employ a substantial number of individuals that are trained and certified by a qualified training program. (4)CertificationFor an applicable bridge project that includes an aspect described in paragraph (2), the entity carrying out the project shall only accept bids from a certified contractor that presents written proof that the certification of the contractor meets the relevant (AMPP) SSPC–QP standards (or a successor standard). (c)Training programAs a condition of entering into a contract for an applicable bridge project, each certified contractor shall provide training for each individual who is not a certified coating applicator but that the certified contractor employs to carry out aspects of applicable bridge projects described in subsection (b)(2).

Section 3:
3.Availability of Federal grant funding for corrosion control work on rail bridgesSection 22402(b)(1) of title 49, United States Code, is amended—(1)in subparagraph (E), by striking or at the end;(2)by redesignating subparagraph (F) as subparagraph (G); and(3)by inserting after subparagraph (E) the following:(F)to perform corrosion control work on rail bridges; or.

Section 4:
4.Study on efficacy of weathering steel(a)FindingsCongress finds that—(1)weathering steel is often used for bridge construction projects because of its ability to withstand weather conditions better than other forms of steel; (2)the collapse of the Fern Hollow Bridge in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in January 2022 highlights the real threat that corrosion poses to the bridges of the United States; (3)more research is needed into the vulnerabilities of weathering steel; and (4)States and units of local government need more information on when and how to address the risk of corrosion to weathering steel. (b)StudyNot later than 18 months after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation shall—(1)carry out a study on best practices for—(A)the frequency and method of inspecting corrosion on weathering steel bridges; and(B)addressing corrosion on weathering steel bridges;(2)submit to the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate, the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate, and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives a report on the results of the study under paragraph (1); and(3)make the report under paragraph (2) available to State departments of transportation, metropolitan planning organizations (as defined in section 134(b) of title 23, United States Code), regional transportation planning organizations (as defined in that section), and units of local government that own bridge assets.
