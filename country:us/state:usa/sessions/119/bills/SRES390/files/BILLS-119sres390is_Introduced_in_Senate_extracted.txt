III119th CONGRESS1st SessionS. RES. 390IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATESSeptember 16, 2025Mr. Wyden (for himself, Mr. Fetterman, Mr. Padilla, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Kaine, Ms. Hirono, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. King, Mr. Warner, Mr. Van Hollen, Mr. Schiff, Mr. Bennet, Ms. Smith, Mr. Coons, Ms. Duckworth, Mr. Welch, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Luján, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Markey, Ms. Alsobrooks, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Booker, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Merkley, Mr. Sanders, and Ms. Blunt Rochester) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the JudiciaryRESOLUTIONDesignating September 2025 as National Voting Rights Month.Whereas voting is 1 of the single most important rights that can be exercised in a democracy;Whereas, over the course of history, various voter suppression laws in the United States have hindered, and even prohibited, certain individuals and groups from exercising the right to vote;Whereas, during the 19th and early 20th centuries, Native Americans and people who were born to United States citizens abroad, people who spoke a language other than English, and people who were formerly subjected to slavery were denied full citizenship and prevented from voting by English literacy tests;Whereas, since the 1870s, minority groups such as Black Americans in the South have suffered from the oppressive effects of Jim Crow laws that were designed to prevent political, economic, and social mobility;Whereas Black Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, Native Americans, and other underrepresented voters were subject to violence, poll taxes, literacy tests, all-White primaries, property ownership tests, and grandfather clauses that were designed to suppress the right of those underrepresented individuals to vote;Whereas, as of 2024, 4,000,000 people in the United States were disenfranchised from voting because of a felony conviction, including 1 in 16 Black adults, due to the shameful entanglement of racial injustice in the criminal legal system and voting access in the United States; Whereas members of the aforementioned groups and others are currently, in some cases, subject to intimidation, voter roll purges, and financial barriers that act effectively as modern-day poll taxes;Whereas, in 1965, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 10301 et seq.) to protect the right of Black Americans and other traditionally disenfranchised groups to vote, among other reasons;Whereas, in 2013, in the landmark case of Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 529 (2013), the Supreme Court of the United States invalidated section 4 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 10303), dismantling the preclearance formula provision in that Act that protected voters in States and localities that historically have suppressed the right of minorities to vote;Whereas, since the invalidation of the preclearance formula provision of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 10301 et seq.), gerrymandered districts in many States have gone unchallenged and have become less likely to be invalidated by the courts;Whereas gerrymandered districts in many States have been found to have a discriminatory impact on traditionally disenfranchised minorities through tactics that include cracking, diluting the voting power of minorities across many districts, and packing, concentrating the power of minority voters into 1 district to reduce their voting power in other districts;Whereas the courts have found the congressional and, in some cases, State legislative district maps in Texas, North Carolina, Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, Alabama, and Louisiana to be gerrymandered districts that were created to favor some groups over others;Whereas, despite courts finding some State legislative district maps to be gerrymandered, Republican-controlled State legislatures in 2025 are actively working to further gerrymandering before future elections are held;Whereas these restrictive voting laws encompass cutbacks in early voting, voter roll purges, placement of faulty equipment in minority communities, requirement of photo identification, and the elimination of same-day registration; Whereas these policies could outright disenfranchise or make voting much more difficult for more than 80,000,000 minority, elderly, poor, and disabled voters, among other groups;Whereas, in 2016, discriminatory laws in North Carolina, Wisconsin, North Dakota, and Texas were ruled to violate the rights of voters and were overturned by the courts;Whereas the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 529 (2013), calls on Congress to update the formula in the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 10301 et seq.);Whereas addressing the challenges of administering future elections requires increasing the accessibility of vote-by-mail and other limited-contact options to ensure access to the ballot and the protection of the health and safety of voters, and access to the ballot amid a global pandemic like the Coronavirus Disease 2019 public health emergency;Whereas Congress must work to combat any attempts to dismantle or underfund the United States Postal Service or obstruct the passage of the mail as blatant tactics of voter suppression and election interference;Whereas following the 2020 elections there has been a relentless attack on the right to vote with more than 400 bills having been introduced to roll back the right to vote, including such bills being introduced in almost every State and at least 44 of such bills having been signed into law in 18 States;Whereas the Trump administration has repeatedly attempted to restrict voter registration and access to the ballot, including vote-by-mail, for eligible citizens of the United States;Whereas there is much more work to be done to ensure all citizens of the United States have the right to vote through free, fair, and accessible elections, and Congress must exercise its constitutional authority to protect the right to vote;Whereas National Voter Registration Day in 2025 is Tuesday, September 16; andWhereas September 2025 would be an appropriate month— (1)to designate as National Voting Rights Month; and (2)to ensure that, through the registration of voters and awareness of elections, the democracy of the United States includes all citizens of the United States: Now, therefore, be itThat the Senate—(1)designates September 2025 as National Voting Rights Month;(2)encourages all people in the United States to uphold the right of every citizen to exercise the sacred and fundamental right to vote;(3)encourages Congress to pass—(A)the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2025 (S. 2523, H. R. 14, 119th Congress), to strengthen protections for voters by restoring and modernizing key protections in the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 10301 et seq.) to prevent discriminatory gerrymandering and to ensure minority voting rights are safeguarded; and(B)other voting rights legislation that seeks to advance voting rights and protect elections in the United States;(4)recommends that public schools and universities in the United States develop an academic curriculum that educates students about—(A)the importance of voting, how to register to vote, where to vote, and the different forms of voting; (B)the history of voter suppression in the United States before and after passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 10301 et seq.); and(C)current measures that have been taken to restrict the vote;(5)expresses appreciation for the United States Postal Service having issued a special Representative John R. Lewis stamp—(A)to honor the life and legacy of Representative John R. Lewis in supporting voting rights; and(B)to remind people in the United States that ordinary citizens risked their lives, marched, and participated in the great democracy of the United States so that all citizens would have the fundamental right to vote; and (6)invites Congress to allocate the requisite funds for public service announcements on television, radio, newspapers, magazines, social media, billboards, buses, and other forms of media—(A)to remind people in the United States when elections are being held;(B)to share important registration deadlines; and (C)to urge people to get out and vote.
