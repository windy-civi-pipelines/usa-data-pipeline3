Whereas 66 percent of undocumented immigrants have lived in the United States for over a decade, making them deeply rooted in American communities; Whereas mass deportations would therefore cause serious harm for families, disrupt local economies, and destabilize essential labor markets; 
Whereas there are approximately 4,700,000 mixed-status households comprised of 16,700,000 people who share a home with at least 1 undocumented resident; Whereas an estimated 5,500,000 American-born, United States-citizen children live with an undocumented family member; 
Whereas, since January 20, 2025, the Trump administration has established informal arrest quotas, revived family detention centers, and doubled detention capacity to nearly 100,000, including on military bases, vastly expanding the number of individuals and families experiencing immigration detention; Whereas, since January 20, 2025, individuals have been wrongfully targeted, detained, and even deported; 
Whereas, since January 20, 2025, the use of expedited deportation has been vastly expanded, stripping due process rights from immigrants who wish to contest their removal; Whereas 71.7 percent of people currently detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (hereinafter referred to ICE) have no criminal convictions; 
Whereas 93 percent of those detained by ICE have never been convicted of a violent offense; Whereas individuals are now experiencing elevating levels of anxiety, hypervigilance, and panic attacks due to immigration enforcement; 
Whereas family separation is a significant concern among migrants and their communities; Whereas ICE is stripping people of legal status and arresting them at courthouses; 
Whereas individuals are now experiencing increased social isolation and loneliness to avoid potential ICE activity; Whereas family separation caused by incarceration or deportation can be more detrimental to children’s health, behavior, and academic achievement than parental death or divorce, with children deportees displaying higher rates of depression, anxiety, and academic withdrawal; 
Whereas family separation caused by incarceration and deportation disproportionately affects poor people and racial minorities whose communities are already more likely to be under stress and unable to compensate for the parental loss, thereby exacerbating structural inequalities; and Whereas, on June 14, 2025, protests occurred across the Nation against stringent immigration enforcement: Now, therefore, be it
