<paragraph id="HD3D513C72C3B4A1D8E93E8408783A221"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Paul W. <quote>Bud</quote> Bucha turned down several scholarships for both academics and athletics and instead enrolled in the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. He went on to be a two-time All-American and captain of the West Point swim team. In 1965, he graduated in the top 5 percent of his class and number two in Military Order of Merit.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H62224F51E6144772BB47AC0DE2EA86C9"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Paul W. <quote>Bud</quote> Bucha earned a Masters of Business Administration from Stanford University in 1967, all while completing Airborne and Ranger training between academic years.</text></paragraph>

His company was the last rifle company to be formed during an Army expansion. He jokingly recalled that his recruits were men who had flunked basic infantry tasks, former prisoners, and <quote>guys with master’s degrees in Elizabethan literature</quote>. He took pride in his company, dubbed the <quote>clerks and jerks</quote>. They went on to become one of the most decorated units by the end of the war.</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="H227EC2C654794342B5CB7993B469B0B7"><enum>(8)</enum><text>Paul W. <quote>Bud</quote> Bucha distinguished himself with extraordinary heroism while leading 89 men on a reconnaissance mission near Phuoc Vinh, Vietnam, from March 16th through 18th, 1968. As part of the Tet Offensive, his unit was dropped by helicopter and his men set out to repel attacks by North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces. As the sun set on March 18, 1968, he and his men advanced into a dense jungle and found themselves outgunned by approximately 1,500 enemy troops. Under attack, he crawled 40 yards through the hail of fire and singlehandedly destroyed a machine-gun bunker with grenades, all while sustaining a shrapnel wound. He then orchestrated an overnight offensive, directing his men to spread out, throw grenades, and unleash heavy fire. He made the enemy believe they were a much larger force. His leadership led to the defeat of a superior Vietnamese stronghold, leaving 156 enemy dead. Come morning, he guided the medical evacuation of three air-ambulance loads of seriously wounded personnel.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H1B0F100AC74C4F778503B5EA5E83F6D4"><enum>(9)</enum><text>President Richard Nixon presented the Medal of Honor to Paul W. <quote>Bud</quote> Bucha in a ceremony at the White House in 1970.</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="H84A59C5F4B804DEF863C2338C795C508"><enum>(10)</enum><text>Paul W. <quote>Bud</quote> Bucha originally wanted to turn down the Medal of Honor because he did not feel deserving. In Vietnam, he asked his men to trust him and, in turn, promised to bring them home safe. 10 of his men were killed on the night of March 18, 1968. Paul W. <quote>Bud</quote> Bucha ultimately accepted the Medal of Honor in their memory, saying it belongs to his men.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H80506172F10149348B2DE075F02CFB99"><enum>(11)</enum><text>Paul W. <quote>Bud</quote> Bucha resigned his Army commission in 1972.</text></paragraph>

He believed that all veterans, whether they have <quote>4 stars or no stripes, man or woman</quote>, would be touched by post-traumatic stress. He used the term <quote>post-traumatic stress</quote> to acknowledge the impact of combat experiences on the mental health of veterans and he intentionally left out the word <quote>disorder</quote> to help destigmatize their struggle.</text></paragraph>
