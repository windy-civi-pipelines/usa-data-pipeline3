Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following: 
(1)Pakistan is an important and valued partner of the United States. (2)On December 10, 1948, Pakistan became one of the original signatories to, and supported the creation of, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). 
(3)On June 23, 2010, Pakistan ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). (4)Following the end of the most recent period of military rule in 2008, Pakistan completed its first peaceful transition of power between civilian governments led by different political parties in 2013, but the military continues to exert undue influence on the politics of the country. 
(5)During previous elections, such as the ones held in 2018, election monitors expressed concern about constraints on the freedom of expression and freedom of association and noted allegations of influence by the military-led establishment on the electoral process. (6)The Department of State’s Country Report on Human Rights Practices has often highlighted significant human rights issues in Pakistan across multiple years, including unlawful, arbitrary, and extrajudicial killings, forced disappearance and arbitrary detention by the state or its agents, the taking of political prisoners, serious restrictions on free expression and media, and substantial interference with the freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of association. 
(7)On February 8, 2024, millions of Pakistanis participated in Pakistan’s most recent general election, with record numbers of women, youth, and members of religious and ethnic minority groups registered to vote Pakistan’s civil society—including women’s networks and youth groups—have continued to be resilient in their efforts to constructively engage political leaders and government institutions in more democratic, accountable, and responsive governance. (8)Pakistan’s 2024 general election was marked by allegations by credible international and local observers of interference in the electoral process, including electoral violence, intimidation, arrest of political actors, restrictions to freedom of assembly, restrictions on freedom of expression, and restrictions on access to the internet and telecommunications. 
(9)On February 9, 2024, the Department of State noted that it shared the assessment of observers that the election included undue restrictions on freedoms of expression, association, and peaceful assembly, condemned electoral violence as well as restrictions on the exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and called for the full investigation of fraud or interference in Pakistan’s general elections.  (10) In October 2024, the Government of Pakistan ratified the 26th Amendment to the Pakistani constitution, which increased political influence on the Judicial Commission of Pakistan and over the process to appoint the Chief Justice of Pakistan.
       
(11)In November 2024, Pakistan adopted legislation extending the terms of military service chiefs for two years. (12)On December 23, 2024, the Department of State criticized the use of military courts against Pakistani civilians, noting that they lack judicial independence, transparency, and due process guarantees. 
(13)In August 2025, Pakistan enacted legislation to expand the powers of security and military forces to carry out preventive detentions that contravene international human rights and due process standards, including under the ICCPR. (14)An essential safeguard of democracy is civilian command and control of apolitical military and security forces, and the Constitution of Pakistan states that the Federal Government shall have control and command of the Armed Forces, and the oath taken by members of the Armed Forces swears they will uphold the Constitution and not engage in any political activities. 
(15)Democracy, development, rule of law, and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing.
