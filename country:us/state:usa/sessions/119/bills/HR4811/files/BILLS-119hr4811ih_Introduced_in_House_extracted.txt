 3119. Cell-site simulators 
 (a) Prohibition of use 
 (1) In general Except as provided in subsection (d), it shall be unlawful—  (A) for any individual or entity to knowingly use a cell-site simulator in the United States; or  
 (B) for an element of the intelligence community to use a cell-site simulator outside the United States if the subject of the surveillance is a United States person.    (2) Rule of construction Nothing in paragraph (1) shall be construed to authorize a law enforcement agency of a governmental entity to use a cell-site simulator outside the United States.   
 (b) Penalty Any individual or entity that violates subsection (a)(1) shall be fined not more than $250,000.   (c) Prohibition of use as evidence  (1) In general Except as provided in paragraph (2), no information acquired through the use of a cell-site simulator in violation of subsection (a)(1), and no evidence derived therefrom, may be received in evidence in any trial, hearing, or other proceeding in or before any court, grand jury, department, officer, agency, regulatory body, legislative committee, or other authority of the United States, a State, or a political subdivision thereof.  
 (2) Exception for enforcement Information acquired through the use of a cell-site simulator in violation of subsection (a)(1) by a person, and evidence derived therefrom, may be received in evidence in any trial, hearing, or other proceeding described in paragraph (1) of this subsection relating to the alleged violation of subsection (a)(1) in connection with such use.    (d) Exceptions  (1) In general  (A) Warrant  (i) In general Subsection (a)(1) shall not apply to the use of a cell-site simulator by a law enforcement agency of a governmental entity under a warrant issued— 
 (I) in accordance with this subparagraph; and   (II) using the procedures described in, and in accordance with the requirements for executing and returning a warrant under, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (or, in the case of a State court, issued using State warrant and execution and return procedures and, in the case of a court-martial or other proceeding under chapter 47 of title 10 (the Uniform Code of Military Justice), issued under section 846 of that title and in accordance with the requirements for executing and returning such a warrant, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the President) by a court of competent jurisdiction.   
 (ii) Requirements A court may issue a warrant described in clause (i) (except, with respect to a State court, to the extent use of a cell-site simulator by a law enforcement agency of a governmental entity is prohibited by the law of the State) only if the law enforcement agency—  (I) demonstrates that other investigative procedures, including electronic location tracking methods that solely collect records of the investigative target— 
 (aa) have been tried and have failed; or   (bb) reasonably appear to be— 
 (AA) unlikely to succeed if tried; or   (BB) too dangerous;    
 (II) specifies the likely area of effect of the cell-site simulator to be used and the time that the cell-site simulator will be in operation;   (III) certifies that the requested area of effect and time of operation are the narrowest reasonably possible to obtain the necessary information; and

(iii) Considerations In considering an application for a warrant described in clause (i), the court shall— 
 (I) weigh the need of the government to enforce the law and apprehend criminals against the likelihood and impact of any potential negative side effects disclosed by the government under subparagraph (C); and   (II) not grant a request for a warrant that would put public safety at risk or unreasonably inconvenience the community.   
 (iv) Period of initial authorization No warrant described in clause (i) may authorize the use of a cell site simulator for any period longer than is necessary to achieve the objective of the authorization, nor in any event for longer than 30 days.   (v) Extensions  (I) In general A court may grant extensions of a warrant described in clause (i), but only upon application for an extension made in accordance with clause (i) and the court considering the factors described in clause (iii) and determining the requirements under clause (ii) are met.

(vi) Termination provision Each warrant described in clause (i), and each extension thereof, shall contain a provision that the authorization to use the cell site simulator shall be executed as soon as practicable and shall terminate upon attainment of the authorized objective, or in any event in 30 days.  
 (vii) Start of 30-day periods The 30-day periods described in clauses (iv), (v)(II), and (vi) shall begin on the earlier of—  (I) the date on which a law enforcement agency first begins to use the cell site simulator as authorized by the warrant, or extension thereof; or  
 (II) the date that is 10 days after the warrant, or extension thereof, is issued.     (B) Emergency  (i) In general Subject to clause (ii), subsection (a)(1) shall not apply to the use of a cell-site simulator by a law enforcement agency of a governmental entity, or use of a cell-site simulator as part of assistance provided by a component of the Department of Defense or an Armed Force to such a law enforcement agency, if— 
 (I) the governmental entity reasonably determines an emergency exists that—  (aa) involves— 
 (AA) immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person;   (BB) conspiratorial activities characteristic of organized crime; or  
 (CC) an immediate threat to a national security interest; and    (bb) requires use of a cell-site simulator before a warrant described in subparagraph (A) can, with due diligence, be obtained; and   
 (II) except in an instance in which the governmental entity is trying to locate a lost or missing person, locate someone believed to have been abducted or kidnapped, or find victims, dead or alive, in an area where a natural disaster, terrorist attack, or other mass casualty event has taken place—  (aa) there are grounds upon which a warrant described in subparagraph (A) could be entered to authorize such use; and  
 (bb) the governmental entity applies for a warrant described in subparagraph (A) approving such use not later than 48 hours after such use begins, and takes such steps to expedite the consideration of such application as may be possible.     (ii) Termination of emergency use  (I) In general A law enforcement agency of a governmental entity shall immediately terminate use of a cell-site simulator under clause (i) of this subparagraph at the earlier of the time the information sought is obtained or the time the application for a warrant described in subparagraph (A) is denied.
