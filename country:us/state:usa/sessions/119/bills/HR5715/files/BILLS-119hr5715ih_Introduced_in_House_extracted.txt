Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the October 7 Gold Medal Act.

Section 2:
2.FindingsThe Congress finds the following: 
(1)On October 7, 2023, Hamas terrorists launched a brutal, unprovoked attack from Gaza into Israel, killing more than 1,200 people, including at least 30 Americans, according to the Israeli military and the United States Department of State. (2)In the early morning hours of that day, Hamas forces stormed across the border, infiltrating Israeli towns and communities, slaughtering civilians, including women, children, and the elderly; ambushing music festival attendees; and attacking Israeli Defense Forces bases. 
(3)251 individuals were taken hostage during the attack, including 12 American citizens—some of whom were killed during abduction or later died while in captivity. (4)Among those kidnaped were children, seniors, and young adults, many of whom were dragged from their homes and communities to be held in brutal conditions inside Hamas’s labyrinth of tunnels underneath Gaza, in clear violation of international humanitarian law and the Geneva Conventions. 
(5)These hostages, including Americans, endured unspeakable conditions in captivity—denied medical care, isolated from their families, and endured psychological abuse during their imprisonment. (6)Despite the horror of that day, countless civilians and Israeli soldiers responded with extraordinary courage, risking and sacrificing their lives to protect others. First responders, community members, and soldiers fought valiantly to repel terrorists, rescue hostages, and save lives in neighborhoods under siege. 
(7)Among those who fell that day or shortly thereafter were true heroes—civilians who shielded children, soldiers who died defending their comrades, and neighbors who gave their lives in acts of selfless bravery. (8)The families of American hostages, both those who were freed and those who remain in captivity, have demonstrated relentless courage, resilience, and unity in advocating for their loved ones—exemplifying the best of the American spirit and values. 
(9)On May 12, 2025—584 days after the October 7 attacks—the final living American hostage was released from Hamas captivity. (10)As of the date of this resolution, hostages still remain in captivity, including 2 Americans. The United States Congress continues to call for their immediate and unconditional release. 
(11)The bravery of American hostages, the fallen, and their families deserves recognition by the Nation. Their suffering, sacrifice, and perseverance in the face of terrorism reflect the strength and resilience of the American people.
