2.Congressional approval requirement for advanced AI chip exports to China 
(a)In generalNo person may export, reexport, or transfer an advanced AI semiconductor to the People’s Republic of China unless— (1)the Secretary of Commerce has approved such export, reexport, or transfer pursuant to subsection (b); and 
(2)Congress has enacted a joint resolution approving such export, reexport, or transfer pursuant to subsection (c). (b)Executive branch approval process (1)Interagency reviewBefore approving any export, reexport, or transfer under subsection (a)(1), the Secretary of Commerce shall conduct an interagency review involving the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of State, and the Director of National Intelligence in coordination with the appropriate elements of the intelligence community (as such term is defined in section 3 of the National Security Act of 1947). 
(2)Factors for considerationIn conducting the review under paragraph (1), the Secretaries shall consider— (A)the potential impact on United States national security; 
(B)the potential impact on United States technological leadership; (C)the risk of enabling military applications by the People’s Republic of China; 
(D)the risk of enabling the perpetration of human rights abuses in the People’s Republic of China; (E)the availability of comparable technology at a comparable volume from other sources; and 
(F)the economic impact on United States companies and workers.
