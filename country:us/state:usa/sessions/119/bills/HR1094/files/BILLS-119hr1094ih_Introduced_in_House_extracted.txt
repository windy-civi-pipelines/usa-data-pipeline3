Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Amateur Radio Emergency Preparedness Act.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following:(1)More than 770,000 amateur operators in the United States are licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (in this section referred to as the Commission) in the amateur radio services, and, by treaty, amateur operators licensed by other countries are authorized to operate within the United States.(2)Amateur radio, in addition to providing life-saving emergency communications at no cost to taxpayers, provides a fertile ground for technical self-training in modern telecommunications, electronics technology, and emergency communications techniques and protocols.(3)There is a strong Federal interest in the effective performance of amateur stations established at the residences of amateur operators. Among other reasons, when an emergency arises, it can be too late, and too dangerous, to erect an effective antenna. However, amateur stations have been shown to be frequently and increasingly precluded by unreasonable private land use restrictions, including restrictive covenants.(4)Commission regulations have for more than 3 decades prohibited State and local regulation of amateur station antenna structures that precludes or fails to reasonably accommodate amateur service communications, or that does not constitute the minimum practicable regulation to accomplish a legitimate State or local purpose. The policy of the Commission has been and is to require States and localities to permit erection of a station antenna structure at heights and dimensions sufficient to reasonably accommodate amateur service communications. The Commission struck an appropriate balance by enabling effective use of the amateur service without burdening localities and adjoining properties.(5)The Commission has sought guidance and direction from Congress with respect to the application of the Commission’s limited preemption policy regarding amateur service communications to private land use restrictions, including restrictive covenants.(6)In 1996, Congress provided guidance, direction, and authority to the Commission by directing the Commission to promulgate regulations (Public Law 104–104, title II, section 207, 110 Stat. 114; 47 U.S.C. 303 note) that have preempted all private land use restrictions applicable to exterior communications facilities that impair the ability of citizens to receive television broadcast signals, direct broadcast satellite services, or multichannel multipoint distribution services, or to transmit and receive wireless internet services.(7)To further the public interest benefits that amateur radio brings to society, private land use restrictions that prohibit, restrict, or impair amateur operators from operating, installing, or maintaining effective outdoor amateur station antenna structures should also be preempted.

Section 3:
3.Application of private land use restrictions to amateur station antennas(a)In generalPart I of title III of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 301 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:346.Application of private land use restrictions to amateur station antennas(a)In generalA private land use restriction that prohibits, restricts, or impairs, or has the effect of prohibiting, restricting, or impairing, an amateur operator from operating, installing, or maintaining any amateur station antenna on property subject to the control of the amateur operator may not be adopted or enforced, except as permitted by subsection (b).(b)Permissible restrictions(1)In generalSubject to paragraph (2), the following private land use restrictions applicable to amateur station antennas may be adopted or enforced:(A)A restriction that requires an amateur station antenna to be installed in compliance with the specifications of the manufacturer of the antenna, applicable zoning ordinances, amateur radio tower ordinances (if any), and governmentally adopted building codes.(B)A restriction that requires an amateur station antenna to be maintained in a structurally safe condition.(C)A restriction that requires any deteriorated or structurally unsafe component of an amateur station antenna to be repaired, replaced, or removed.(D)A restriction that requires an amateur station antenna to be removed if the property on which the antenna is located ceases to be subject to the control of an amateur operator.(E)A restriction that requires an amateur station antenna ground-mounted electrical enclosure, ground-mounted control enclosure, or guy wire anchor to be visually screened if such enclosure or anchor—(i)is visible from the street faced by the dwelling;
