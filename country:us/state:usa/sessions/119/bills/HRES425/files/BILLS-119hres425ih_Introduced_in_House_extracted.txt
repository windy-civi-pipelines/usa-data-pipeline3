IV119th CONGRESS1st SessionH. RES. 425IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESMay 17, 2025Mr. Morelle (for himself and Mr. Mast) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Science, Space, and TechnologyRESOLUTIONExpressing support for designation of May 16, 2025, as the National Day of Light. 
Whereas the National Day of Light is aimed at raising awareness of the vital role of light in our daily lives and its importance to 21st-century technology and innovation; Whereas for centuries, light-based technologies have provided solutions to worldwide challenges in energy, agriculture, manufacturing, telecommunications, national security, and health; 
Whereas optics and photonics is the study of the fundamental properties of light and harnessing them for practical applications; Whereas light has revolutionized medicine through technologies such as x-ray imaging, laser surgery, and cancer treatments; 
Whereas light has transformed communication via the internet, a tool we cannot imagine living without today; Whereas light has helped us improve transportation safety with sensors in vehicles and advanced infrastructure monitoring; 
Whereas light has greatly enhanced the ability of the United States to gather intelligence, defend the Nation, and protect its troops in the field; Whereas most of what we have observed in the universe is known only through light-based technologies, first from the visible wavelengths observed by Galileo into x-ray, infrared, and radio waves, and even gravitational waves detected by lasers; 
Whereas advanced manufacturing is possible due to light-based technologies that can provide custom, precise, and high-added value through means such as additive manufacturing; Whereas quantum computing, sensing, and communication systems are largely enabled by light-based technologies; 
Whereas through the National Quantum Initiative Act (Public Law 115–368), the United States is accelerating our investment in quantum information science and the development of commercially available quantum-based technologies, thereby facilitating growth in the economy of the United States and protecting our national security; Whereas 2025 is the 40-year anniversary of the invention of chirped pulse amplification, a technique used to amplify ultrashort laser pulses that was recognized with the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physics and has become the basis of all modern high-power lasers, enabling revolutionary applications of ultraintense light including LASIK laser eye surgery, cancer treatment, commercial laser materials processing, fundamental physics research, and ultrafast imaging including attosecond science; and 
Whereas May 16 is already recognized internationally as the Day of Light: Now, therefore, be it That the House of Representatives—
(1)supports the designation of a National Day of Light; (2)recognizes the continuing importance of the United States as the world leader in light-based science and technologies;
(3)recognizes the importance of inspiring the next generation of scientists, researchers, innovators, technicians, and entrepreneurs; and (4)encourages schools, community colleges, and universities to observe the day with appropriate activities.
