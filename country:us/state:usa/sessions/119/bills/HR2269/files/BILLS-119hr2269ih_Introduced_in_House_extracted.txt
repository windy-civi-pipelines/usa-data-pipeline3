(A)the symbol shall be displayed on the principal display panel and, if the principal display panel is not on the dispensing side of the packaging, on the dispensing side panel; and (B)the label notice shall be displayed on either the principal display panel or the dispensing side panel, in a clear and conspicuous location reasonably visible to the user each time a wipe is dispensed. 
(3)Rigid packagingIn the case of a covered product sold in a refillable tub or other rigid packaging that may be reused by a customer, and that is intended to dispense individual wipes, the symbol and label notice shall be displayed on the principal display panel in a clear and conspicuous location reasonably visible to the user each time a wipe is dispensed.
