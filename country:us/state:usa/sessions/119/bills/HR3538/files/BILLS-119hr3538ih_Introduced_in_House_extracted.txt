Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Wildlife Confiscations Network Act of 2025.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following: 
(1)Wildlife trafficking is a continued and growing threat to our national security, hinders sustainable economic development, and undermines our laws. (2)The connections between trafficking in illegal wildlife and natural resources with the financing of groups involved in transnational organized crime pose additional threats to the United States. 
(3)President Donald J. Trump’s Executive Order No. 13773 demonstrated continued support for Enforcing Federal Law with Respect to Transnational Criminal Organizations and Preventing International Trafficking. (4)The Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 (16 U.S.C. 3371 et seq.) prohibits the importation, exportation, transportation, sale, receipt, acquisition, or purchase of any fish or wildlife or plant taken, possessed, transported, or sold in violation of any law, treaty, or regulation of the United States or any Indian tribal law, or foreign law. 
(5)Congress remains strongly committed to combating wildlife trafficking and transnational organized crime. (6)The United States border is secured by Federal agents and inspectors responsible for identification, seizure, confiscation and holding of illegal imports, including a diverse array of live wild animals, notably at U.S. ports of entry or exit with an increased burden seen in Los Angeles, Miami, and across the Southern border. 
(7)Customs and wildlife enforcement officers at ports of entry have limited holding capacity, care experience, and transportation options for interdicted live wildlife. (8)Numerous species of wildlife require extensive quarantine protocols to protect domestic livestock and wildlife, beyond the capacity of our ports and borders, that can be administered by facilities within the Wildlife Confiscations Network. 
(9)When illegally imported live wild animals and plants are seized at U.S. ports of entry, it is critical for law enforcement to obtain forensic documentation, maintain evidentiary integrity, and ensure the health, wellbeing, and proper care of all seized wildlife and plants in government custody. (10)From 2015 to 2019, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service had 834 cases involving live wildlife interdiction, which included 48,793 individual live animals, an average of nearly 30 per day, requiring placement and care. 
(11)In 2023, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Association of Zoos and Aquariums formed a cooperative agreement to implement a pilot network in southern California to lessen the logistical burden by serving as a point of contact to coordinate placement and care of seized live animals while maintaining legal chain of custody. (12)The Wildlife Confiscations Network provides a cooperative and coordinated response for the care and wellbeing of wildlife confiscated from illegal trade at United States border crossings and points of entry in Southern California from the point of seizure to placement or repatriation and, in just 2 years, has successfully placed over 4,100 individual animals into care. 
(13)Confiscation of trafficked plants and animals is critical to preventing their re-entry into illegal trade, empowering law enforcement to document and maintain evidence of and effectively combat illegal wildlife trafficking. (14)The Wildlife Confiscations Network clearly aligns with OMB Circular A–76 by supporting wildlife law enforcement, an inherently governmental function, and removing the placement and care of confiscated live wildlife from government responsibility. It must be extended and expanded nationwide to allow law enforcement officers across the country to focus on their mission and mandate in combating wildlife crime.

Section 3:
3.DefinitionsIn this Act: (1)CITES speciesThe term CITES species means an animal species that is listed in one of the Appendices of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.
