Section 2:
2.Sense of CongressIt is the sense of Congress that— (1) the fee collected in accordance with section 44940 of title 49, United States Code (commonly known as the 9/11 Security Fee), is an airline passenger-paid fee established with the express purpose of enhancing the safety and security of the aviation system of the United States;

 revenue generated from the 9/11 Security Fee should be used exclusively to fund activities, programs, equipment, and initiatives that directly improve the security of commercial aviation, including passenger and baggage screening, security technology upgrades, and the support of personnel responsible for aviation security;
      
        (3)
 the use of the 9/11 Security Fee for purposes unrelated to aviation security undermines public trust and the original intent of the fee, and all proceeds from the fee should be reserved and expended solely for measures that strengthen the safety and security of the traveling public within the aviation sector; and
      
        (4)
 the diversion of 9/11 Security Fee revenue to other purposes should be ended no later than 2027, in accordance with section 44940(i)(4) of title 49, United States Code, as it read on the date of the enactment of this Act.
