Whereas the Supreme Court of the United States has recognized that family abduction—(1)is a form of child abuse with potentially devastating consequences for a child, which may include negative impacts on the physical and mental well-being of the child; and(2)may cause a child to experience a loss of community and stability, leading to loneliness, anger, and fear of abandonment;Whereas, according to the 2010 Report on Compliance with the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction by the Department of State, an abducted child is at risk of significant short- and long-term problems, including anxiety, eating problems, nightmares, mood swings, sleep disturbances, and aggressive behavior;Whereas international parental child abduction has devastating emotional consequences for the child and for the parent from whom the child is separated;Whereas the United States has a history of promoting child welfare through institutions, including—(1)the Children’s Bureau of the Administration for Children and Families of the Department of Health and Human Services;
