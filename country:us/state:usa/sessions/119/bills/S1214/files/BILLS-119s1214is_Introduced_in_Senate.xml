Nationally, low-income households spend a larger portion of their income on home energy costs than other households. While the average energy burden for non-low-income households is approximately 3 percent, low-income households experience energy burdens that are 3 times higher, with 1 in 4 low-income households spending more than 15 percent of their income on energy bills. The report for the Household Pulse Survey of the Bureau of the Census, issued on October 3, 2024, noted that, for families with incomes of less than $35,000 a year, about 54 percent said that they reduced or went without basic household necessities, such as medicine or food, in order to pay an energy bill, for at least one month in the last year.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HE1593AD56B004053A06A45DB52C6448E"><enum>(2)</enum><text>The Low-Income Housing Energy Assistance Program was authorized by Congress to reduce home energy burdens with heating and cooling assistance.

Over the past 2 decades, the United States has seen a 135 percent increase in billion-dollar winter disasters, fueled by climate change, rising from 31 of those disasters from 1985 through 2004, to 73 of those disasters from 2005 through 2024.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HAA3C4D467B2F4F34AB3EAF2F99C2463A"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Heat waves are increasingly common as climate change accelerates, and now occur more often in major cities across the United States. According to reports from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 2024 was the hottest year on record in Earth’s history. The average heat wave season across 50 cities is approximately 46 days longer now than it was in the 1960s, and the American Medical Association found that heat-related deaths have increased by over 16 percent per year since 2016. However, in fiscal year 2023, less than 3 percent of income-eligible households received cooling assistance under the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, with only 7 percent of funding from the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program going toward cooling needs. As a result, the Federal Government should provide further cooling assistance for communities in need.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="id031a871598ea4a40a0ff0b3c571709e3"><enum>(5)</enum><text>As a result of rising home energy bills and insufficient Federal funding for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, residential utility arrears, or the amount of funds owed by households to their utilities, has climbed to an all-time high of over $21,000,000,000 as of September 2024, with over 21,000,000 households in debt to electric utilities and over 15,000,000 households in debt to natural gas companies.
