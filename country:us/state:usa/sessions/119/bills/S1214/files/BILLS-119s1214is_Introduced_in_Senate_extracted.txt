Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Heating and Cooling Relief Act.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds that:(1)Energy remains unaffordable for low-income households. Nationally, low-income households spend a larger portion of their income on home energy costs than other households. While the average energy burden for non-low-income households is approximately 3 percent, low-income households experience energy burdens that are 3 times higher, with 1 in 4 low-income households spending more than 15 percent of their income on energy bills. The report for the Household Pulse Survey of the Bureau of the Census, issued on October 3, 2024, noted that, for families with incomes of less than $35,000 a year, about 54 percent said that they reduced or went without basic household necessities, such as medicine or food, in order to pay an energy bill, for at least one month in the last year.(2)The Low-Income Housing Energy Assistance Program was authorized by Congress to reduce home energy burdens with heating and cooling assistance. In 2023, only 18 percent of income-eligible households received a subsidy under the program.(3)Climate change is fueling increasingly intense winter storms, frequent hurricanes and wildfires, and extreme temperatures. Over the past 2 decades, the United States has seen a 135 percent increase in billion-dollar winter disasters, fueled by climate change, rising from 31 of those disasters from 1985 through 2004, to 73 of those disasters from 2005 through 2024.(4)Heat waves are increasingly common as climate change accelerates, and now occur more often in major cities across the United States. According to reports from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 2024 was the hottest year on record in Earth’s history. The average heat wave season across 50 cities is approximately 46 days longer now than it was in the 1960s, and the American Medical Association found that heat-related deaths have increased by over 16 percent per year since 2016. However, in fiscal year 2023, less than 3 percent of income-eligible households received cooling assistance under the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, with only 7 percent of funding from the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program going toward cooling needs. As a result, the Federal Government should provide further cooling assistance for communities in need.(5)As a result of rising home energy bills and insufficient Federal funding for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, residential utility arrears, or the amount of funds owed by households to their utilities, has climbed to an all-time high of over $21,000,000,000 as of September 2024, with over 21,000,000 households in debt to electric utilities and over 15,000,000 households in debt to natural gas companies. Nearly 1 out of every 7 households is behind on their electric or gas bill.(6)While most States have shutoff protections that prevent utility companies from disconnecting a customer’s energy service during the coldest winter months, 10 States have no winter shutoff protections, and 29 States have no summer shutoff protections. Even in certain States with winter or summer shutoff protections, shutoffs continue to increase as the period around the hottest and coldest months lengthens. (7)The loss of home energy service due to high energy burdens is one of the primary reasons for homelessness, especially for families with children. In some housing contexts, loss of home energy service is a grounds for eviction.(8)The Federal Government should expand and update the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, as part of a robust Federal social safety net, to—(A)protect families against unaffordable home energy bills and home energy shutoffs, by providing sufficient funding and imposing regulations where necessary;(B)ensure all low- and moderate-income families have access to affordable home cooling powered by renewable energy, which will enable households to adapt to rising temperatures due to climate change and promote climate and energy resiliency;(C)enhance timely and meaningful public participation and outreach—(i)by including nontraditional partners, including home energy suppliers, local educational agencies, and entities carrying out other programs for low-income people, to assist with signups; and(ii)by adding stronger provisions for presumed eligibility and waiving documentation requirements for eligibility; and(D)further Federal efforts to weatherize housing for low- and moderate-income households, to help families struggling to pay their home energy bills and to meet national clean energy goals.

II119th CONGRESS1st SessionS. 1214IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATESMarch 31, 2025Mr. Markey (for himself, Mr. Blumenthal, Ms. Blunt Rochester, Mr. Booker, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Padilla, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Van Hollen, Ms. Warren, Mr. Whitehouse, and Mr. Wyden) introduced the following bill; which was read twice and referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and PensionsA BILLTo amend the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981 to increase the availability of heating and cooling assistance, and for other purposes.1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Heating and Cooling Relief Act.2.FindingsCongress finds that:(1)Energy remains unaffordable for low-income households. Nationally, low-income households spend a larger portion of their income on home energy costs than other households. While the average energy burden for non-low-income households is approximately 3 percent, low-income households experience energy burdens that are 3 times higher, with 1 in 4 low-income households spending more than 15 percent of their income on energy bills. The report for the Household Pulse Survey of the Bureau of the Census, issued on October 3, 2024, noted that, for families with incomes of less than $35,000 a year, about 54 percent said that they reduced or went without basic household necessities, such as medicine or food, in order to pay an energy bill, for at least one month in the last year.(2)The Low-Income Housing Energy Assistance Program was authorized by Congress to reduce home energy burdens with heating and cooling assistance. In 2023, only 18 percent of income-eligible households received a subsidy under the program.(3)Climate change is fueling increasingly intense winter storms, frequent hurricanes and wildfires, and extreme temperatures. Over the past 2 decades, the United States has seen a 135 percent increase in billion-dollar winter disasters, fueled by climate change, rising from 31 of those disasters from 1985 through 2004, to 73 of those disasters from 2005 through 2024.(4)Heat waves are increasingly common as climate change accelerates, and now occur more often in major cities across the United States. According to reports from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 2024 was the hottest year on record in Earth’s history. The average heat wave season across 50 cities is approximately 46 days longer now than it was in the 1960s, and the American Medical Association found that heat-related deaths have increased by over 16 percent per year since 2016. However, in fiscal year 2023, less than 3 percent of income-eligible households received cooling assistance under the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, with only 7 percent of funding from the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program going toward cooling needs. As a result, the Federal Government should provide further cooling assistance for communities in need.(5)As a result of rising home energy bills and insufficient Federal funding for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, residential utility arrears, or the amount of funds owed by households to their utilities, has climbed to an all-time high of over $21,000,000,000 as of September 2024, with over 21,000,000 households in debt to electric utilities and over 15,000,000 households in debt to natural gas companies. Nearly 1 out of every 7 households is behind on their electric or gas bill.(6)While most States have shutoff protections that prevent utility companies from disconnecting a customer’s energy service during the coldest winter months, 10 States have no winter shutoff protections, and 29 States have no summer shutoff protections. Even in certain States with winter or summer shutoff protections, shutoffs continue to increase as the period around the hottest and coldest months lengthens. (7)The loss of home energy service due to high energy burdens is one of the primary reasons for homelessness, especially for families with children. In some housing contexts, loss of home energy service is a grounds for eviction.(8)The Federal Government should expand and update the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, as part of a robust Federal social safety net, to—(A)protect families against unaffordable home energy bills and home energy shutoffs, by providing sufficient funding and imposing regulations where necessary;(B)ensure all low- and moderate-income families have access to affordable home cooling powered by renewable energy, which will enable households to adapt to rising temperatures due to climate change and promote climate and energy resiliency;(C)enhance timely and meaningful public participation and outreach—(i)by including nontraditional partners, including home energy suppliers, local educational agencies, and entities carrying out other programs for low-income people, to assist with signups; and(ii)by adding stronger provisions for presumed eligibility and waiving documentation requirements for eligibility; and(D)further Federal efforts to weatherize housing for low- and moderate-income households, to help families struggling to pay their home energy bills and to meet national clean energy goals.3.FundingSection 2602 of the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981 (42 U.S.C. 8621) is amended—(1)in subsection (b)—(A)by striking section 2607A) and inserting section 2604(e), 2605(u), 2607A, 2607B, or 2607C); and(B)by striking $2,000,000,000 and all that follows and inserting such sums as may be necessary, including such sums as may be necessary to enable the States to assist all households that meet the eligibility requirements established under this title and to enable States to implement home energy affordability measures described in section 2605(b)(3).; (2)in subsection (e), in the first sentence—(A)by striking in each fiscal year;(B)by striking $600,000,000 and inserting $2,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2026, and $2,000,000,000 plus such additional sums as may be necessary for each fiscal year thereafter,; and(C)by inserting , or arising from a major disaster, as defined in section 2604(e)(1) before the period at the end; and (3)by adding at the end the following:(f)There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out section 2607C, including making grants under that section, $1,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2026, and $1,000,000,000 plus such additional sums as may be necessary for each fiscal year thereafter..4.DefinitionsSection 2603 of the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981 (42 U.S.C. 8622) is amended—(1)by redesignating paragraphs (4) through (6), (7) through (10), and (11), as paragraphs (6) through (8), (10) through (13), and (15), respectively; (2)by inserting after paragraph (3) the following:(4)The terms extreme heat and extreme cold, used with respect to a period, means a period in which there is an increased risk of—(A)heat-related or cold-related, respectively, illness, hospitalization, or death; or(B)failures or energy shutoffs of home cooling or heating, respectively.(5)The term HEAP coordinator means an employee—(A)who administers a program funded under section 2602(b); and (B)whose salary is paid, partly or wholly, with funds made available under that section.;(3)by inserting after paragraph (8), as so redesignated, the following:(9)The term local coordinating agency means any local organization or local office that receives funds under section 2602(b) to perform customer intake, or approval of benefits, on behalf of the State agency.; and(4)by inserting after paragraph (13), as so redesignated, the following:(14)The term State agency means any State agency that administers the program funded under section 2602(b)..5.Assistance for emergencies and major disasters, including extreme heat and coldSection 2604 of the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981 (42 U.S.C. 8623) is amended—(1)in subsection (a)(1)(B), by striking section 2605(b)(9)(B) and inserting section 2605(b)(10)(B); and(2)in subsection (e)—(A)by striking (e) and inserting the following: (e)(1) In this subsection:(2); (B)in paragraph (1), by adding at the end the following:(A)The term covered household means an eligible household in an area where the President, or the Secretary, as the case may be, has declared or determined the occurrence of a natural disaster, emergency, or major disaster.
