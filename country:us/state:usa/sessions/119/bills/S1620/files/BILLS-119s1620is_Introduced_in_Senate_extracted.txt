 This Act may be cited as the Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement Act or the MEME Act.

Section 2:
2.
            Sense of Congress
 It is the sense of Congress that—  (1) federally elected officials must not utilize those positions, granted by the trust of the public, for private financial gain;
            
            
                (2)
 the issuance, sponsorship, or promotion of financial instruments by public office holders deprives the public of the honest services of the public office holders, facilitates bribery by investors or purchasers, and results in public exploitation and corrupt foreign influence; and
            
            
                (3)
 Members of Congress and the executive branch must not seek to use public office to benefit financially, but rather those positions should be held in trust for the benefit of the public in the United States.

        II
        119th CONGRESS
        1st Session
        S. 1620
        IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
        
            May 6, 2025
            Mr. Murphy introduced the following bill;
                which was read twice and referred to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental
                Affairs
        
        A BILL
        To amend chapter 131 of title 5, United States Code, with respect to
            prohibited financial transactions, and for other purposes.
    
    
        
            1.
            Short title
 This Act may be cited as the Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement Act or the MEME Act.
        
        
            2.
            Sense of Congress
 It is the sense of Congress that—  (1) federally elected officials must not utilize those positions, granted by the trust of the public, for private financial gain;
            
            
                (2)
 the issuance, sponsorship, or promotion of financial instruments by public office holders deprives the public of the honest services of the public office holders, facilitates bribery by investors or purchasers, and results in public exploitation and corrupt foreign influence; and
            
            
                (3)
 Members of Congress and the executive branch must not seek to use public office to benefit financially, but rather those positions should be held in trust for the benefit of the public in the United States.
            
        
        
            3.
            Prohibited financial transactions
            
                (a)
                Financial exploitation by public office holders
                
                    (1)
                    In general
 Chapter 131 of title 5, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:
                    
                        
                            IV
                            Financial exploitation by public office holders
                            
                                13151.
