Section 2:
2.Purpose; sense of Congress(a)PurposeThe purpose of this Act is to remove barriers to immigration status for non-citizen survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, human trafficking, and other crimes who may be eligible for protections under the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (VAWA) and the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (TVPA) and other vulnerable immigrants.(b)Sense of CongressIt is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of Homeland Security should reduce barriers to, and provide victims timely access to the immigration protections such as those created in VAWA and the TVPA, as well as refrain from deporting crime victims before their applications for humanitarian relief are fully adjudicated, as it undermines critical bi-partisan protections created in VAWA and the TVPA.
