IV119th CONGRESS1st SessionH. RES. 576IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESJuly 10, 2025Mr. Torres of New York (for himself, Ms. Clarke of New York, Mr. Goldman of New York, and Mr. Espaillat) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on EthicsRESOLUTIONCensuring Representative Andy Ogles. 
Whereas Representative Andy Ogles has publicly and repeatedly used racist rhetoric to demean the House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a highly respected African-American Member of Congress, as Discount Dollar Store Obama, mocking his identity and diminishing his leadership through racist tropes; Whereas Representative Ogles has used anti-Muslim rhetoric to attack the Democratic nominee for Mayor of New York City, New York State Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani; 
Whereas Representative Ogles has repeatedly called for the deportation of Assemblymember Mamdani, solely on the basis of his political beliefs and religion; Whereas Representative Ogles is abusing his office by calling on United States Attorney General Pam Bondi to deport a Muslim-American Democratic nominee, whom he disparages as little Muhammad, simply because Assemblymember Mamdani is Muslim; 
Whereas Representative Ogles’s public statements suggest a willingness to silence political positions and target naturalized citizens by weaponizing the Department of Justice and our Nation’s immigration laws; Whereas targeting a political candidate or any American citizen for deportation based solely on their lawful political views represents an authoritarian impulse contradictory with the Constitution of the United States; 
Whereas anti-Muslim hate, racism, and ethnic slurs have no place in public discourse, and only serve to divide and endanger diverse communities as well as subject public officials across the country to harassment and death threats; Whereas Representative Ogles’s statements are un-American, antithetical to the values of a pluralistic and multiethnic democracy, and beneath the dignity of the House of Representatives; and 
Whereas the House of Representatives has a responsibility to uphold standards of conduct and condemn hate speech that undermines the legitimacy and safety of public service: Now, therefore, be it That— 
(1)Representative Andy Ogles be censured; (2)Representative Andy Ogles forthwith present himself in the well of the House of Representatives for the pronouncement of censure; and 
(3)Representative Andy Ogles be censured with the public reading of this resolution by the Speaker.
