Without parental knowledge or consent, schools are changing the names and pronouns of children in school, provided or allowed students to bring clothes typically worn by the opposite sex for students to change into once they arrive at school, or even allowing children to change which sex-segregated facilities they use, such as rest rooms, locker rooms, and dormitories or other housing for overnight field trips.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H08ED1377C139417980DAF9226583298F"><enum>(2)</enum><text>This is often being done pursuant to a <quote>gender transition plan</quote> that is nearly always kept secret from parents. In fact, these school districts have kept a second set of student records that are unknown to the parents. Powerful teachers unions and activist organizations have pressured more schools to adopt policies to enable and encourage children, of any age, to adopt an <quote>identity</quote> that is incongruent with their sex and be treated accordingly at school without parental notice or consent.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H04175AC90136433DBC4DA28A99194443"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Contrary to the unfounded assertions of activists, the social aspects of adopting an identity that is incongruent with an individual’s sex are not neutral or uncontroversial. This is experimental and has immediate effects on a child’s psychology and dramatically increases the statistical likelihood that a child will go on to take puberty blocking or suppressing drugs and wrong-sex hormones. Additionally, it makes it more difficult for a child to reverse course later on, thereby increasing the likelihood that the child will continue on to the surgical elements of adopting an identity that is incongruent with one’s sex, resulting in life-changing, irreversible consequences.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H0984162A5AC6476FB488D17C187D7F14"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Any policies that attempt to circumvent parental authority are a violation of parents’ constitutionally protected rights to direct the care, custody, and upbringing of their children as recognized by the Supreme Court. Further, policies that withhold information from parents or ask children about intimate details of their family life violate Federal statutes designed to uphold a parent’s rights and duties in education. School districts implementing such policies are misrepresenting or entirely ignoring these statutes and constitutional protections.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HF71388201E994A94A77B753664AEFC45"><enum>(5)</enum><text>On January 29, 2025, President Trump signed Executive Order 14191 <quote>Ending Radical Indoctrination in K–12 Schooling</quote>, to enforce the law to ensure that recipients of Federal funds providing K–12 education comply with all laws protecting parental rights.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H23C99C9CD89049F0ACCF3176C43F4FB1"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Schools should never be allowed to intrude on family life by misleading or excluding parents and confusing children.</text></paragraph></section><section id="HF5AC3AEA510548839BA52ED2D4BC205B"><enum>3.</enum><header>Requirements of parental consent</header><subsection id="H269B423893A6428482CF24DD01613B7A"><enum>(a)</enum><header>In general</header><text>No Federal funds shall be made available to any elementary school or secondary school unless the elementary school or secondary school, with respect to students enrolled at the school who have not yet reached 18 years of age, complies with each of the following requirements:</text><paragraph id="H321FAD04E308499AB312BC5EB9D2CC80"><enum>(1)</enum><text>School employees do not proceed with any accommodation intended to affirm a student’s purported <quote>identity</quote> that is incongruent with the student’s sex, or any action to facilitate or otherwise aid and abet a minor in adopting such an identity, including referral or recommendation to any third-party medical provider for a gender transition procedure, unless the employees have received express parental consent to do so.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H9744D27F7B3B430894F1FF0882F6D956"><enum>(2)</enum><text>School employees do not facilitate, encourage, or coerce students to withhold information from their parents regarding the student’s purported identity, when it is incongruent with the student’s sex.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HA8C32332F4B84F5EB15E5C0AE48D8ADC"><enum>(3)</enum><text>School employees do not withhold or hide information from parents about a student’s discomfort with their sex, their desire for an identity that is incongruent with their sex, their profession of an identity that is incongruent with their sex, or their desire to undergo a gender transition procedure.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HE242333B642345D29281293A4F26EDE5"><enum>(4)</enum><text>School employees do not encourage, pressure, or coerce the parents of students, or students themselves, to proceed with any intervention to affirm the student’s adoption of an identity that is incongruent with their sex.</text></paragraph></subsection><subsection id="HEF7A962C307546518AC42818A26D92E1"><enum>(b)</enum><header>Rules of construction</header><text>Nothing in this section shall be construed—</text><paragraph id="H6473E3E6D4F54E3B8EB6D1319BE5669D"><enum>(1)</enum><text>to prevent a school employee from contacting appropriate legal authorities about an imminent threat to a student’s physical safety in the event that the school employee knows or has a reasonable suspicion that the student is at risk of physical abuse, as defined in section 1169 of title 18, United States Code;
