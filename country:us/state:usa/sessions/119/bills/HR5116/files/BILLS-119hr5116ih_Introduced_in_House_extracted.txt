Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Empower Parents to Protect their Kids Act.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following:(1)School districts across the country have violated parental and familial rights by encouraging or instructing staff to deceive or withhold information from parents if their child expresses discomfort with their sex or is seeking to socially or physically adopt an identity that is incongruent with their sex. Without parental knowledge or consent, schools are changing the names and pronouns of children in school, provided or allowed students to bring clothes typically worn by the opposite sex for students to change into once they arrive at school, or even allowing children to change which sex-segregated facilities they use, such as rest rooms, locker rooms, and dormitories or other housing for overnight field trips.(2)This is often being done pursuant to a gender transition plan that is nearly always kept secret from parents. In fact, these school districts have kept a second set of student records that are unknown to the parents. Powerful teachers unions and activist organizations have pressured more schools to adopt policies to enable and encourage children, of any age, to adopt an identity that is incongruent with their sex and be treated accordingly at school without parental notice or consent.(3)Contrary to the unfounded assertions of activists, the social aspects of adopting an identity that is incongruent with an individual’s sex are not neutral or uncontroversial. This is experimental and has immediate effects on a child’s psychology and dramatically increases the statistical likelihood that a child will go on to take puberty blocking or suppressing drugs and wrong-sex hormones. Additionally, it makes it more difficult for a child to reverse course later on, thereby increasing the likelihood that the child will continue on to the surgical elements of adopting an identity that is incongruent with one’s sex, resulting in life-changing, irreversible consequences.(4)Any policies that attempt to circumvent parental authority are a violation of parents’ constitutionally protected rights to direct the care, custody, and upbringing of their children as recognized by the Supreme Court. Further, policies that withhold information from parents or ask children about intimate details of their family life violate Federal statutes designed to uphold a parent’s rights and duties in education. School districts implementing such policies are misrepresenting or entirely ignoring these statutes and constitutional protections.(5)On January 29, 2025, President Trump signed Executive Order 14191 Ending Radical Indoctrination in K–12 Schooling, to enforce the law to ensure that recipients of Federal funds providing K–12 education comply with all laws protecting parental rights.(6)Schools should never be allowed to intrude on family life by misleading or excluding parents and confusing children.
