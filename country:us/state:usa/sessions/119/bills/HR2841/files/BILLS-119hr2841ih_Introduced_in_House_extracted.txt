2.Findings and Sense of Congress(a)FindingsCongress finds the following:(1)In the United States, nongovernmental organizations, or NGOs, often assist the Federal government with distribution of resources to the American People and abroad.

(6)To empower lawmakers to make responsible decisions with Americans’ tax dollars and provide transparency to the American People, all Americans should have access to the megadonors of NGOs that leverage Federal dollars for their own agenda.(b)Sense of CongressIt is the sense of Congress that any nongovernmental organization that receives Federal funding of any kind is acting on behalf of the United States government and subject to the same fiscal oversight requirements as executive agencies.
