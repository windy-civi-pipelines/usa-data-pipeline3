Whereas for children and adolescents aged 2–19 years in 2017 through 2020 the prevalence of obesity was 19.7 percent and affected about 14,700,000 children and adolescents; Whereas the obesity prevalence was 26.2 percent among Hispanic children, 24.8 percent among non-Hispanic Black children, 16.6 percent among non-Hispanic White children, and 9.0 percent among non-Hispanic Asian children;
Whereas studies indicate that obese children are more likely to become obese adults and suffer lifelong physical and mental health problems; Whereas unhealthy eating habits and lack of physical activity have contributed to the obesity epidemic in the United States;
Whereas a poor diet is associated with major health risks that can cause illness and even death; Whereas obesity-related conditions include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, breathing problems such as asthma and sleep apnea, and joint problems;
Whereas, in addition to healthy eating, people in the United States can experience positive health benefits and be on the path for a better future by incorporating physical activity into daily life, including 30 minutes for adults and 60 minutes for children; Whereas physical activity can help reduce the risk of chronic conditions such as heart disease, many types of cancer, type 2 diabetes, depression and anxiety, and dementia;
Whereas being physically active can improve brain health, help manage weight, strengthen bones and muscles, and improve sleep quality; and Whereas May 2025, would be an appropriate month to designate as National Physical Fitness and Sports Month: Now, therefore, be it 
That the House of Representatives— (1)supports the designation of National Physical Fitness and Sports Month; and
