Section 2:
2.Intelligent water infrastructure technologySection 220 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1300) is amended—(1)in subsection (b), by adding at the end the following:(3)Intelligent water infrastructure technologyThe term intelligent water infrastructure technology means—(A)intelligent wastewater treatment and collection systems and stormwater management operations, including technologies that rely on—(i)the use of real-time monitoring, management, analytics, and data collection tools, embedded intelligence, and predictive maintenance capabilities that improve the energy efficiency, cost efficiency, reliability, and resiliency of wastewater treatment and collection systems;(ii)real-time remote sensors that provide continuous monitoring of water quality to support optimization; and(iii)the use of artificial intelligence and other intelligent optimization tools that—(I)reduce operational costs, including operational costs relating to energy consumption and chemical treatment;

or(iv)water flow;(I)advanced metering infrastructure, including meter data analytics and ratepayer technology—(i)to improve end-user conservation; and(ii)in support of disadvantaged communities;(J)resilient water supply projects that may provide real-time monitoring of weather patterns and weather-related impacts on water quality and flood protection reservoirs and dams that enhance operations, including—(i)improved water supply reliability and management;(ii)protection of natural resources, including fisheries; and(iii)temperature control;(K)innovative and alternative water supply projects, including groundwater banking, that rely on real-time data acquisition to support predictive aquifer recharge through water reuse and stormwater management capabilities;(L)artificial intelligence and other intelligent optimization tools that—(i)reduce operational costs, including costs relating to energy consumption and chemical treatment of wastewater and stormwater; and(ii)improve decisionmaking; and(M)advanced digital design and construction management technologies and tools relating to water treatment systems and distribution networks the development of advanced digital models.; (2)by striking subsection (f) and inserting the following:(f)Uses of grants(1)In generalAmounts from grants received under this section may be used for engineering, design, construction, and final testing of alternative water source projects designed to meet critical water supply needs.(2)ProhibitionAmounts from grants received under this section may not be used for planning, feasibility studies, operation, or maintenance.(3)Intelligent water infrastructure technologies(A)In generalAmounts from grants received under this section may be used for engineering, design, construction, implementation, training, and operations relating to the adoption and use of intelligent water infrastructure technology.(B)ApplicabilityFor purposes of paragraph (2), any costs with respect to intelligent water infrastructure technology shall not be considered operation or maintenance costs.;(3)by striking subsection (h) and inserting the following:(h)Reports(1)In generalNot later than 180 days after the date of enactment of the Water Infrastructure Modernization Act of 2025, and not less frequently than annually thereafter, the Administrator shall submit to Congress a report that—(A)describes—(i)the projects awarded grants for the purposes described in subsection (f)(3); and(ii)the improvements in the resiliency that resulted from grants awarded under this section; and(B)includes any recommendations of the Administrator to improve the ability of grants under this section to achieve the uses described in subsection (f).(2)Initial reportIn the initial report required under paragraph (1), the Administrator shall include a description of the implementation of this section, including a description of—(A)the projects for which a grant was sought under this section for the purposes described in subsection (f)(3) that were denied; and(B)for each of the projects described in subparagraph (A), the reasons for which the grant was denied.; and(4)in subsection (i)(1)—(A)by striking $25,000,000 and inserting $50,000,000; and(B)by striking 2026 and inserting 2028.
