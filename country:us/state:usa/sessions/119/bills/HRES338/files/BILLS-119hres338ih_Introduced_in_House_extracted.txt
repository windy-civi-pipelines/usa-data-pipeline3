Whereas nearly one fourth of the population of Cambodia at the time were killed during the genocide; Whereas, April 17th, 2025, marks the 50th anniversary of the beginning of the Cambodian Genocide; 
Whereas by designating April 17th as a day of remembrance, the utmost respect and reverence can be given to the lives that were lost; Whereas recognizing this day serves to honor those who survived the genocide with the utmost admiration; 
Whereas Cambodian communities have found new beginnings across the United States, acting as a symbol of resiliency and strength; Whereas, in 2019, the cities of Lowell, Los Angeles, and Long Beach proclaimed April 17th to be Cambodian Genocide Remembrance Day; and
