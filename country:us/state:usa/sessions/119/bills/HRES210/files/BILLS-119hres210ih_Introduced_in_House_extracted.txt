Whereas the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); Whereas the first cases of what later came to be known as AIDS were reported in the United States in 1981, marking the beginning of the global HIV/AIDS epidemic; 
Whereas HIV continues to spread in the United States and around the world, and AIDS-related illnesses continue to kill thousands of people in the United States and globally; Whereas, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there are more than 1,200,000 people living with HIV in the United States, and approximately 22 percent of them are women; 
Whereas, every year in the United States, there are approximately 31,800 new HIV infections, and 8,000 people die with HIV-related illnesses; Whereas women accounted for 19 percent of new HIV diagnoses in the United States in 2022; 
Whereas, according to an estimate from the CDC, 13 percent of those who are infected with HIV in the United States do not know they are infected; Whereas women of color, especially African-American women, are disproportionately affected by HIV in the United States, accounting for the majority of new HIV diagnoses, the majority of women living with HIV, and the majority of deaths among women with HIV; 
Whereas, in the United States, African-American women account for 50 percent of new HIV diagnoses among women, Latina women account for 20 percent of new HIV diagnoses among women, and Asian-American women, Native American women, and women of multiple races account for an additional 5 percent of new HIV diagnoses among women; Whereas the CDC recommends that all patients between the ages of 13 and 64 get tested for HIV at least once as part of routine health care, and that patients who may have risk factors for HIV be screened at least annually; 
Whereas the CDC recommends that all pregnant women be screened for HIV; Whereas, when a woman living with HIV receives comprehensive care before, during, and after a pregnancy, it significantly reduces the risk of passing HIV to her child; 
Whereas the Joint United Nations Program on HIV and AIDS (UNAIDS) leads global efforts to stop the spread of HIV and respond to the worldwide HIV/AIDS epidemic; Whereas, according to UNAIDS, globally, more than 42,000,000 people have died from AIDS-related illnesses since the beginning of the epidemic, and 630,000 people died from AIDS-related illnesses in 2023;

Whereas, every week, 4,000 adolescent girls and young women between the ages of 15 and 24 years became infected with HIV globally in 2023, and 3,100 of these infections occurred in sub-Saharan Africa; Whereas inequitable gender norms, transactional sex, sexual violence, sexually transmitted infections, and early pregnancy continue to drive new HIV infections among women and girls in many countries; 
Whereas women and adolescent girls face serious challenges with respect to the prevention of HIV infection due to inadequate access to evidence-based and rights-based, age-appropriate, and comprehensive sexuality and HIV-prevention education and tools, including— (1)pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and testing; 
(2)sexual- and gender-based violence prevention and care services; and (3)sexual and reproductive health information and services, including screening and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, and access to a full range of contraceptive methods, including male and female condoms; 
Whereas National Women and Girls HIV/AIDS Awareness Day is observed on March 10, 2025; and Whereas, each year on March 10, individuals, organizations, and policymakers across the United States participate in National Women and Girls HIV/AIDS Awareness Day to increase awareness of, spark conversations on, and highlight the work being done to reduce the incidence of HIV among women and girls while showing support for those with HIV: Now, therefore, be it
