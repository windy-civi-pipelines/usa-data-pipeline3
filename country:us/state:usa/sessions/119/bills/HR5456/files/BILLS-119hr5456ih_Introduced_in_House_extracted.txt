Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the NOAA Weather Radio Modernization Act of 2025 or the NWR Modernization Act of 2025 .

Section 2:
2.DefinitionsIn this Act:(1)AdministratorThe term Administrator means the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere and the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.(2)NOAA weather radioThe term NOAA Weather Radio means the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Weather Radio All Hazards network.

Section 3:
3.FindingsCongress finds the following:(1)The NOAA Weather Radio is a nationwide network of transmitters that are critical to protecting life and property by broadcasting weather and other hazard alerts.(2)NOAA Weather Radio broadcasts currently reach 95 percent of the United States population.(3)NOAA Weather Radio broadcasts originate from all National Weather Service Offices, but are only available via a receiver located in sufficient proximity to a radio transmitting tower.(4)There are limited options to obtain NOAA Weather Radio broadcasts via the Internet or mobile device application, which are provided by volunteer mechanisms obtaining the audio feed in an ad hoc manner.(5)NOAA Weather Radio should provide equal access and availability to unimpeded broadcasts of weather and non-weather hazards to every person located within the United States, its territories, and Tribal lands.

Section 4:
4.Upgrading existing systems(a)In generalThe Administrator shall, to the maximum extent practicable, expand coverage of the NOAA Weather Radio and ensure its reliability. In carrying out this subsection, the Administrator shall—(1)maintain support for existing systems serving areas not covered by or having poor quality cellular service;(2)ensure consistent maintenance and operations monitoring, with timely repairs to broadcast transmitter site equipment and antennas; and(3)enhance the ability to amplify Non-Weather Emergency Messages via NOAA Weather Radio as necessary.(b)Expanding accessIn carrying out subsection (a), the Administrator shall acquire additional transmitters as required to expand coverage to rural and underserved communities, national parks, and recreation areas.

Section 5:
5.Modernization initiative(a)In generalIn parallel to the activities under section 4, the Administrator shall, to the maximum extent practicable, enhance NOAA Weather Radio to ensure its capabilities and coverage remain valuable to the public. In carrying out this section, the Administrator shall—(1)upgrade telecommunications infrastructure to accelerate the transition of broadcasts to internet protocol-based communications over noncopper media;(2)accelerate software upgrades to the Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System, or the relevant system successors, to implement partial county notifications and alerts;(3)consult with relevant stakeholders, including the private sector, to enhance accessibility and usability of NOAA Weather Radio data and feeds;(4)develop options, including satellite backup capability and commercial provider partnerships, for NOAA Weather Radio continuity in the event of Weather Forecast Office outages;(5)research and develop alternative options, including microwave capabilities, to transmit NOAA Weather Radio signals to transmitters that are remote or do not have internet protocol capability; and(6)transition critical applications to the Integrated Dissemination Program, or the relevant program successors.(b)PriorityIn carrying out subsection (a), the Administrator shall prioritize practices, capabilities, and technologies recommended in accordance with the assessment under subsection (c) to maximize accessibility, particularly in remote and underserved areas of the country.(c)Assessment for management and distributionNot later than 12 months after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall complete an assessment of access to NOAA Weather Radio. In conducting such assessment, the Administrator shall take into consideration and provide recommendations on the following:(1)The need for continuous, adequate, and operational real-time broadcasts of the NOAA Weather Radio in both urban and rural areas.(2)Solicited inputs from relevant stakeholders on the compatibility of NOAA Weather Radio data for third party platforms that provide online services, such as websites and mobile device applications, or deliver NOAA Weather Radio access.(3)Existing or new management systems that promote consistent, efficient, and compatible access to NOAA Weather Radio.(4)The ability of NOAA to aggregate real time broadcast feeds at one or more central locations.(5)Effective interagency coordination.(6)The potential effects of an electromagnetic pulse or geomagnetic disturbance on NOAA Weather Radio.(7)Any other function the Administrator determines necessary.
