Section 7:
101.Findings, purposes, and policySection 2 (16 U.S.C. 1801) is amended—(1)in subsection (a)—(A)by amending paragraph (2) to read as follows:(2)Certain stocks of fish have declined to the point where their survival is threatened, and other stocks of fish have been so substantially reduced in number that they could become similarly threatened as a consequence of—(A)increased fishing pressure;(B)inadequate fishery resource conservation and management practices and controls; (C)direct and indirect habitat losses that result in a diminished capacity to support existing fishing levels; or(D)changing environmental conditions, including those associated with climate change.;(B)in paragraph (6), by striking to insure conservation, and inserting to ensure conservation, to account for the impacts of environmental changes on stocks of fish,;(C)by amending paragraph (9) to read as follows:(9)One of the greatest long-term threats to the viability of commercial and recreational fisheries is the continuing degradation of marine ecosystems, including the loss of marine, estuarine, and other aquatic habitats, including as a result of changing environmental conditions associated with climate change. Habitat and ecosystem considerations should receive increased attention for the conservation and management of fishery resources of the United States. ; and(D)by adding at the end the following:(14)Environmental changes associated with climate change, including changes in water temperature, ocean acidification, and deoxygenation, are rapidly altering the abundance, productivity, and distribution of fish and are affecting commercial, recreational, and subsistence fisheries.(15)The impacts of climate change on fish and their habitats are resulting in management and sustainability challenges that threaten to negatively impact marine ecosystems, fishery resources, and coastal communities.(16)Many factors beyond the direct impacts of fishing can contribute to a decline in abundance of a stock of fish, resulting in depleted stocks of fish and threatening the stability of ecosystems and fishing communities, including climate change, pollution, habitat and watershed degradation, inadequate freshwater resources, and industrial uses of the ocean. The designation of a stock of fish as overfished indicates that it is depleted and management actions are necessary to allow the stock of fish to rebuild, regardless of the cause of depletion.;(2)in subsection (b), by amending paragraph (5) to read as follows:(5)to establish Regional Fishery Management Councils to exercise sound judgement in the stewardship of fishery resources through the preparation, monitoring, and revision of such plans under circumstances—(A)which will enable the States, the fishing industry, consumer and environmental organizations, and other interested persons to participate in, and advise on, the establishment and administration of such plans;(B)which take into account the social and economic needs of the States; and(C)which address the impacts of environmental conditions associated with climate change on stocks of fish, marine ecosystems, fisheries management, and coastal communities;; and(3)in subsection (c)—(A)in paragraph (6), by striking and at the end;(B)in paragraph (7), by striking the period at the end and inserting a semicolon; and(C)by adding at the end the following:(8)to promote management that accounts for changes in stocks of fish and the marine environment that result from climate change; and(9)to ensure that the research, resource management, and expenditures to prepare fisheries and fishing communities for climate change include indigenous, insular, and coastal populations in decisionmaking and promote equity with respect to environmental, economic, and social outcomes across fisheries and regions..

While most species function as prey of others at some life stage, especially when small and young, forage fish maintain this important trophic role throughout their life. Further, fluctuations in their populations can result in significant changes in marine communities and ecosystems. Therefore, particular attention to management of forage fish species, and addressing their unique role in marine ecosystems, is critical to maintaining ecosystem function and sustainable fisheries..(b)Definitions(1)Secretary to define forage fishSection 305 (16 U.S.C. 1855) is amended by adding at the end the following:(n)Forage fishNot later than 12 months after the date of the enactment of the Sustaining America’s Fisheries for the Future Act of 2025, the Secretary, with advice from the Councils, shall issue a definition of the term forage fish for the purposes of this Act, giving due consideration to definitions of forage fish included in approved fishery management plans.

Habitat and ecosystem considerations should receive increased attention for the conservation and management of fishery resources of the United States. ; and(D)by adding at the end the following:(14)Environmental changes associated with climate change, including changes in water temperature, ocean acidification, and deoxygenation, are rapidly altering the abundance, productivity, and distribution of fish and are affecting commercial, recreational, and subsistence fisheries.(15)The impacts of climate change on fish and their habitats are resulting in management and sustainability challenges that threaten to negatively impact marine ecosystems, fishery resources, and coastal communities.(16)Many factors beyond the direct impacts of fishing can contribute to a decline in abundance of a stock of fish, resulting in depleted stocks of fish and threatening the stability of ecosystems and fishing communities, including climate change, pollution, habitat and watershed degradation, inadequate freshwater resources, and industrial uses of the ocean. The designation of a stock of fish as overfished indicates that it is depleted and management actions are necessary to allow the stock of fish to rebuild, regardless of the cause of depletion.;(2)in subsection (b), by amending paragraph (5) to read as follows:(5)to establish Regional Fishery Management Councils to exercise sound judgement in the stewardship of fishery resources through the preparation, monitoring, and revision of such plans under circumstances—(A)which will enable the States, the fishing industry, consumer and environmental organizations, and other interested persons to participate in, and advise on, the establishment and administration of such plans;(B)which take into account the social and economic needs of the States;

or(IV)for such other reasons as the Secretary determines appropriate.(B)Finding of inadequate progress(i)In generalExcept as provided in subparagraph (C), if the Secretary finds after a review under subparagraph (A) that a management document has not resulted in adequate progress toward rebuilding affected stocks of fish, the Secretary shall—(I)in the case of a stock of fish to which section 302(a)(3) applies, immediately make revisions necessary to achieve adequate progress toward rebuilding the stock of fish by the deadline established under paragraph (4);

While most species function as prey of others at some life stage, especially when small and young, forage fish maintain this important trophic role throughout their life. Further, fluctuations in their populations can result in significant changes in marine communities and ecosystems. Therefore, particular attention to management of forage fish species, and addressing their unique role in marine ecosystems, is critical to maintaining ecosystem function and sustainable fisheries..(b)Definitions(1)Secretary to define forage fishSection 305 (16 U.S.C. 1855) is amended by adding at the end the following:(n)Forage fishNot later than 12 months after the date of the enactment of the Sustaining America’s Fisheries for the Future Act of 2025, the Secretary, with advice from the Councils, shall issue a definition of the term forage fish for the purposes of this Act, giving due consideration to definitions of forage fish included in approved fishery management plans.
