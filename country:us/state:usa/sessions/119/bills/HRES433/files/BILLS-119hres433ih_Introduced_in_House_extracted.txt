Trump.Whereas, on May 15, 2025, former Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) James B. Comey posted a disturbing image on social media depicting the phrase, 86–47, with cool shell formation cryptically written as the post’s caption;Whereas this message, posted by an individual who previously served as one of the top law enforcement officials in the United States, seemingly calls for and encourages the elimination of the sitting President of the United States, Donald J. Trump;Whereas this message was posted to Mr. Comey’s public social media account amidst President Trump’s first overseas visit to the Middle East, jeopardizing the President’s security and invigorating our Nation’s enemies abroad;Whereas it is completely indefensible and inexcusable for the former Director of the FBI, a senior public servant, to issue a call for political violence against the duly elected President of the United States;Whereas Director Comey has, for years, exhibited a clear desire to undermine President Trump and engaged in routine misuses of power as the Director of the FBI, routinely leaking sensitive information in the hopes of delegitimizing the President;Whereas political violence is never acceptable, particularly in light of the 2 assassination attempts made against President Trump’s life over the course of the 2024 general election campaign, in West Palm Beach, Florida, and in Butler, Pennsylvania, where the President was struck by an assassin’s bullet;Whereas the American public deserves better than former public officials using their past office and influence accrued through public service to threaten the lives of their political opponents; andWhereas Congress must take all available action to hold Director Comey accountable, preserve the rule of law, and protect our legal institutions from those that seek to sow discord and promote violence against their political opponents: Now, therefore, be itThat the House of Representatives—(1)unequivocally condemns James Comey’s apparent incitement of political violence made against President Trump;(2)urges the relevant authorities to take every relevant action to ensure that Mr. Comey is never again permitted to serve as an employee of the Federal Government; and(3)requests that the Department of Justice conduct a full and comprehensive investigation into Mr. Comey’s incitement of violence against the President, and release the findings of that investigation to the relevant House Committees and the public.
