Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Prohibiting Threatened and Endangered Creature Trophies Act of 2025 or the ProTECT Act of 2025.

Section 2:
2.FindingsThe Congress finds the following: 
(1)Trophy hunting of imperiled species undermines efforts to conserve wildlife populations because trophy hunters routinely target the biggest, strongest males, and removing those individuals from the population can decrease genetic variation, decrease reproduction, alter social structures, increase infanticide, and cause unnatural evolutionary impacts. (2)When trophy hunting of imperiled species is sanctioned, poaching activity increases, further threatening the survival of wildlife populations. 
(3)Legal trade in wildlife parts and products can provide cover for markets for illegal trade in wildlife products, which is worth up to $20,000,000,000 annually and run by professional criminal networks linked to other transnational organized criminal activities, including trafficking in narcotics, weapons, and humans. (4)While the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) currently prohibits the take and import of species listed under that Act as endangered species, it does not automatically extend those protections to species listed as threatened species.

Section 3:
