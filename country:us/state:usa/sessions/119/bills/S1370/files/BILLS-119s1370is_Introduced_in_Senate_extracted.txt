(42)The term large capacity ammunition feeding device—(A)means a magazine, belt, drum, feed strip, helical feeding device, or similar device, including any such device joined or coupled with another in any manner, that— (i)has an overall capacity of, or that can be readily restored, altered, or converted to accept, more than 10 rounds of ammunition;
