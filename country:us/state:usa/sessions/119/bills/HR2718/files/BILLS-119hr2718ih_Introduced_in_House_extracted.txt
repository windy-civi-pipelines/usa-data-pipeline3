Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Family Notification of Death, Injury, or Illness in Custody Act of 2025.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following:(1)In the event an individual dies or becomes seriously ill or injured while being detained, arrested, or while in law enforcement custody, their family members deserve to be notified in a timely and compassionate manner. Such notification is necessary to uphold the basic human dignity of incarcerated people, a concept rooted in the Eighteenth Amendment and Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.(2)The lack of a national standard governing notification of death, illness, and injury that occur in prisons, jails and police custody can lead to inhumane treatment of incarcerated people and their loved ones. Poor communication regarding the death of a loved one may exacerbate the grief and other physical and psychological reactions of surviving relatives.(3)On Easter Sunday of 2016, Wakiesha Wilson was found dead in her cell in the Los Angeles Police Department’s Metropolitan Detention Center. Her mother called the police to determine Ms. Wilson’s whereabouts but was not initially given any information. It was not until March 30, 3 days later, when Ms. Wilson’s mother was told to call the coroner that she learned her daughter had died.(4)In Georgia, Jennifer Bradley testified before the General Assembly in September 2021 that she is still waiting for answers about the stabbing death of her 23-year-old son at Macon State Prison in March 2020. She told the committee that it was an incarcerated person, not a prison official, who first notified her of her son’s death. As of the hearing, she had not yet received his belongings.(5)Jordan Fisher found out about the death of her father, Thomas Willis, at Valdosta State Prison in Georgia when a letter she had sent her father was returned back to her stamped: Return to sender: inmate dead. She was unable to obtain further information about her father’s death from prison officials. What information she uncovered came from letters from her father’s cellmate.(6)Sara Roth did not receive notice from the Clayton County Jail in Georgia that her mother, Regina Salman, had fallen and suffered serious injuries, including a collapsed lung that required hospitalization. When her mother’s longtime boyfriend went to visit the jail, he was told Ms. Salman was no longer there but was not provided additional information. More than a month later, the hospital called Ms. Roth and informed her that her mother was on a ventilator and dying of a severe brain tumor. Her mother was taken off the ventilator 3 days later without ever regaining consciousness.(7)The failure to release autopsy results can prevent families and loved ones from seeking justice for wrongful deaths. After Harvey Hill was arrested for trespassing and booked into jail in Canton, Mississippi, guards beat him severely and kicked him repeatedly in the head. Mr. Hill died in an isolation cell. The State medical examiner’s report recorded his death as a homicide, but it was not released until 25 months after his death and 13 months after the statute of limitations expired for assault.(8)In recent years, deaths in custody have reached the highest levels on record. In 2018, two years prior to the rapid spread of COVID–19 behind bars, at least 1,120 people died while detained in local jails and 4,513 people died in the custody of State and Federal prisons. This represented an all-time high in the number of deaths in both local jails and State prisons since the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) started collecting mortality data.(9)The spread of COVID–19 behind bars significantly increased the death toll of people in custody. At least 2,700 people are estimated to have died of COVID–19 in prisons, jails and detention centers, and the COVID–19 death rate in State and Federal prisons between April 2020 and April 2021 was more than double that of the general population. This is likely a significant undercount, given uneven and inconsistent reporting. In some instances, people are released from local jails to die in hospitals, whether of COVID–19 or other causes, and their deaths are not recorded as a death in custody.

Section 3:
