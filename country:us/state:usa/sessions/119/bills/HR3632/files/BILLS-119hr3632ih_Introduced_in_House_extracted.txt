(2)RequirementsThe Commission, in an order, rule, or regulation issued under paragraph (1)— 
(A)may not— (i)compel the enlargement of generating facilities; or 
(ii)compel the public utility to sell or exchange electric energy when to do so would impair its ability to render proper, adequate, or sufficient service to its customers;  (B)may require— 
(i)continuing the operation of an electric generating unit; and (ii)any affected State commission, Transmission Organization, or public utility to develop and implement a long-term plan for the planning, construction, and operation of interstate transmission facilities that may be necessary for the public utility to provide adequate and sufficient interstate service; and  
(C)shall determine— (i)any rate or charge necessary to provide compensation for the additional costs of the proper, adequate, or sufficient service to be furnished, including compensation to an owner or operator of an electric generating unit that is required to continue to operate under such order, rule, or regulation; and 
(ii)the cost allocation of any rate or charge.    (3)Term lengthExcept as provided in paragraph (4), an order, rule, or regulation issued under paragraph (1) shall terminate on the date that the Commission determines appropriate, which may not be later than 5 years after the date on which the Commission issues such order, rule, or regulation.

(b)Advance notice of planned retirements (1)In generalIf an owner or operator of a generating facility plans to retire an electric generating unit that is a component of such facility, such owner or operator shall submit to the Commission and any affected State commission or Transmission Organization a notice of such plan at least 5 years before the date on which such owner or operator plans to retire such electric generating unit. 
(2)Unplanned retirementsAn owner or operator of a generating facility that retires an electric generating unit due to an unplanned catastrophe, emergency, disaster, or similar event that renders such electric generating unit inoperable is not subject to the notice requirement described in paragraph (1). (3)Publicly availableThe Commission shall make publicly available each notice submitted under paragraph (1). 
(c)DefinitionsIn this section: (1)Bulk-power systemThe term bulk-power system has the meaning given such term in section 215(a). 
(2)Electric generating unitThe term electric generating unit means an electric energy producing unit that— (A)is a component of a generating facility; 
(B)has a power production capacity of not less than 5 megawatts; and (C)is interconnected to the bulk-power system.  
(3)RetireThe term retire, with respect to an electric generating unit, means to, for an indefinite period of time— (A)idle the electric generating unit; 
(B)disconnect the electric generating unit from the bulk-power system; or (C)otherwise make unavailable for sale all electric energy that is generated by the electric generating unit. .
