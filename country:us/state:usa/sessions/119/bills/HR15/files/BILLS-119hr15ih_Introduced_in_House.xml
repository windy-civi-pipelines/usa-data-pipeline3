id="HC5A88F9B5A7E4525BD9337183CCF476C"><enum>(1)</enum><text>Discrimination can occur on the basis of the sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition of an individual, as well as because of sex-based stereotypes. Each of these factors alone can serve as the basis for discrimination, and each is a form of sex discrimination.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H70FF492A3A5C4CDE8B5C2D829C084EF0"><enum>(2)</enum><text>A single instance of discrimination may have more than one basis. For example, discrimination against a married same-sex couple could be based on the sex stereotype that marriage should only be between heterosexual couples, the sexual orientation of the two individuals in the couple, or both. In addition, some persons are subjected to discrimination based on a combination or the intersection of multiple protected characteristics. Discrimination against a pregnant lesbian could be based on her sex, her sexual orientation, her pregnancy, or on the basis of multiple factors.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H6814ECC4A2FA4A39A8E837745F4F00B7"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (referred to as <quote>LGBTQ</quote>) people commonly experience discrimination in securing access to public accommodations—including restaurants, senior centers, stores, places of or establishments that provide entertainment, health care facilities, shelters, government offices, youth service providers including adoption and foster care providers, and transportation. Forms of discrimination include the exclusion and denial of entry, unequal or unfair treatment, harassment, and violence. This discrimination prevents the full participation of LGBTQ people in society and disrupts the free flow of commerce.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HE3F9FB904DBC492987D32FB4536F47C3"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Women also have faced discrimination in many establishments such as stores and restaurants, and places or establishments that provide other goods or services, such as entertainment or transportation, including sexual harassment, differential pricing for substantially similar products and services, and denial of services because they are pregnant or breastfeeding.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H954A5710C8DA4E7D9A7D1467A5E2372E"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Many employers already and continue to take proactive steps, beyond those required by some States and localities, to ensure they are fostering positive and respectful cultures for all employees. Many places of public accommodation also recognize the economic imperative to offer goods and services to as many consumers as possible.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H79DE33DA9BAE424580F172C2544AA753"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Regular and ongoing discrimination against LGBTQ people, as well as women, in accessing public accommodations contributes to negative social and economic outcomes, and in the case of public accommodations operated by State and local governments, abridges individuals’ constitutional rights.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HC1368F1854224B2DACEECB0540994A3B"><enum>(7)</enum><text>The discredited practice known as <quote>conversion therapy</quote> is a form of discrimination that harms LGBTQ people by undermining individuals’ sense of self-worth, increasing suicide ideation and substance abuse, exacerbating family conflict, and contributing to second-class status.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H333951FBBBEA4E02B031A694DCFD35D3"><enum>(8)</enum><text>Both LGBTQ people and women face widespread discrimination in employment and various services, including by entities that receive Federal financial assistance.

In many circumstances, such discrimination also violates other constitutional rights such as those of liberty and privacy under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HC3008AC4EAD846BF925FA11D21166CDC"><enum>(11)</enum><text>Individuals who are LGBTQ, or are perceived to be LGBTQ, have been subjected to a history and pattern of persistent, widespread, and pervasive discrimination on the bases of sexual orientation and gender identity by both private sector and Federal, State, and local government actors, including in employment, housing, and public accommodations, and in programs and activities receiving Federal financial assistance. This discrimination inflicts a range of tangible and intangible harms, sometimes even including serious physical injury or death. An explicit and comprehensive national solution is needed to address this discrimination, including the full range of remedies available under the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HFC89572E2B354CCB9DCCE87E3B5A6343"><enum>(12)</enum><text>Discrimination based on sexual orientation includes discrimination based on an individual’s actual or perceived romantic, emotional, physical, or sexual attraction to other persons, or lack thereof, on the basis of gender. LGBTQ people, including gender nonbinary people, also commonly experience discrimination because of sex-based stereotypes. Many people are subjected to discrimination because of others’ perceptions or beliefs regarding their sexual orientation. Even if these perceptions are incorrect, the identity imputed by others forms the basis of discrimination.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H6D05CA451E4D4A28AA3DFF7B3F1A7824"><enum>(13)</enum><text>Numerous provisions of Federal law expressly prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex, and Federal courts and agencies have correctly interpreted these prohibitions on sex discrimination to include discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex stereotypes. In particular, the Supreme Court of the United States correctly held in Bostock v. Clayton County, 140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020) that the prohibition on employment discrimination because of sex under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 inherently includes discrimination because of sexual orientation or transgender status.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HCCEE998C24674089863077A517F1830E"><enum>(14)</enum><text>This Act makes explicit that existing Federal statutes prohibiting sex discrimination in employment (including in access to benefits), healthcare, housing, education, credit, and jury service also prohibit sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H7A0426BEFAB14948B708A7A9F678B60C"><enum>(15)</enum><text>LGBTQ people often face discrimination when seeking to rent or purchase housing, as well as in every other aspect of obtaining and maintaining housing. LGBTQ people in same-sex relationships are often discriminated against when two names associated with one gender appear on a housing application, and transgender people often encounter discrimination when credit checks or inquiries reveal a former name.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HF3657B9FEEA14BA2810751908F716E50"><enum>(16)</enum><text>National surveys, including a study commissioned by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, show that housing discrimination against LGBTQ people is very prevalent. For instance, when same-sex couples inquire about housing that is available for rent, they are less likely to receive positive responses from landlords. A national matched-pair testing investigation found that nearly one-half of same-sex couples had encountered adverse, differential treatment when seeking elder housing. According to other studies, transgender people have half the homeownership rate of non-transgender people and about 1 in 5 transgender people experience homelessness. Another survey found that 82 percent of gender nonbinary people experiencing homelessness lacked access to shelter.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H8FB92574CBB34A8D9FBB6E57FB2EB7AC"><enum>(17)</enum><text>As a result of the absence of explicit prohibitions against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, credit applicants who are LGBTQ, or are perceived to be LGBTQ, have unequal opportunities to establish credit. LGBTQ people can experience being denied a mortgage, credit card, student loan, or many other types of credit simply because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HF4B53AA9F1E84C60944F362906ED7358"><enum>(18)</enum><text>Numerous studies demonstrate that LGBTQ people, especially transgender people and women, are economically disadvantaged and at a higher risk for poverty compared with other groups of people.

There is, however, an unfortunate and long-documented history in the United States of attorneys discriminating against LGBTQ individuals, or those perceived to be LGBTQ, in jury selection. Failure to bar peremptory challenges based on the actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity of an individual not only erodes a fundamental right, duty, and obligation of being a citizen of the United States, but also unfairly creates a second class of citizenship for LGBTQ victims, witnesses, plaintiffs, and defendants.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H6D0A54629AC34928B198F802AF0188B4"><enum>(20)</enum><text>Numerous studies document the shortage of qualified and available homes for the approximately 424,000 youth in the child welfare system and the negative outcomes for the many youth who live in group care as opposed to a loving home or who age out of care without a permanent family placement. Although same-sex couples are 7 times more likely to foster or adopt than their different-sex counterparts, many child-placing agencies refuse to serve same-sex couples and LGBTQ individuals. This has resulted in a reduction of the pool of qualified and available homes for youth in the child welfare system who need placement on a temporary or permanent basis. It also sends a negative message about LGBTQ people to children and youth in the child welfare system about who is, and who is not, considered fit to be a parent. While the priority should be on providing the supports necessary to keep children with their families, when removal is required, barring discrimination in foster care and adoption will increase the number of homes available to foster children waiting for foster and adoptive families.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H0BAAF18D579342BEB08E101F25B3A606"><enum>(21)</enum><text>LGBTQ youth are overrepresented in the foster care system by at least a factor of two and report twice the rate of poor treatment while in care compared to their non-LGBTQ counterparts. LGBTQ youth in foster care have a higher average number of placements, higher likelihood of living in a group home, and higher rates of hospitalization for emotional reasons and of juvenile justice involvement than their non-LGBTQ peers because of the high level of bias and discrimination that they face and the difficulty of finding affirming foster placements. Further, due to their physical distance from friends and family, traumatic experiences, and potentially unstable living situations, all youth involved with child welfare services are at risk for being targeted by traffickers seeking to exploit children. Barring discrimination in child welfare services will ensure improved treatment and outcomes for LGBTQ foster children.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H89F1300D72C44541ADEBD10D4341D2F4"><enum>(22)</enum><text>Courts consistently have found that the government has a compelling interest in preventing and remedying discrimination. For example, the Supreme Court of the United States found there to be a compelling government interest in eliminating sex discrimination in Board of Directors of Rotary International v. Rotary Club of Duarte, 481 U.S. 537, 549 (1987). Because discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity inherently is a form of sex discrimination, as held in Bostock v. Clayton County, 140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020), this Act furthers the compelling government interest in providing redress for the serious harms to mental and physical health, financial security and well-being, civic participation, freedom of movement and opportunity, personal dignity, and physical safety that result from discrimination. Consistent with the role nondiscrimination laws play in protecting lives and livelihoods, alleviating suffering, and improving individual and public health, the Supreme Court of the United States has long recognized, under the decision in Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U.S. 241 (1964), that these laws also benefit society as a whole by ending the <quote>disruptive effect</quote> discrimination has on travel and commerce, and by creating a level field for all participants in a given sector.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HD8CB92E4F7ED4BCFAD5D7A4651963129"><enum>(23)</enum><text>As with all prohibitions on invidious discrimination, this Act furthers the government’s compelling interest in the least restrictive way because only by forbidding discrimination is it possible to avert or redress the harms described in this subsection.</text></paragraph></subsection><subsection id="HE2C688B2328A47A89940539BC76DF100"><enum>(b)</enum><header>Purpose</header><text>It is the purpose of this Act to expand as well as clarify, confirm and create greater consistency in the protections and remedies against discrimination on the basis of all covered characteristics and to provide guidance and notice to individuals, organizations, corporations, and agencies regarding their obligations under the law.</text></subsection></section><section id="HA609918A1428435EB0E1FD92E961E4D0"><enum>3.</enum><header>Public accommodations</header><subsection id="HA22E86BCC020437CA7A9DC56E441556D"><enum>(a)</enum><header>Prohibition on discrimination or segregation in public accommodations</header><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Section 201 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (<external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/42/2000a">42 U.S.C. 2000a</external-xref>) is amended—</text><paragraph id="HD991BB4ECAEB41898D64C6EE24CB085A"><enum>(1)</enum><text>in subsection (a), by inserting <quote>sex (including sexual orientation and gender identity),</quote> before <quote>or national origin</quote>;
