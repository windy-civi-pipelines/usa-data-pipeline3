            Sense of Congress

                (2)
 Federal legislation providing for the collection of beneficial ownership information for corporations, limited liability companies, or other similar entities formed under the laws of the States is needed to—
                
                    (A)

                    (E)
 bring the United States into compliance with international anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism standards;

                (4)
 the Secretary of the Treasury and the Administrator should work with small business concerns and other reporting companies to provide clarity and minimize burdens on them while still generating a highly useful database;
            
            
                (5)
 an overwhelming bipartisan majority of Congress codified the provisions of paragraphs (1) through (4) in the enactment of the Corporate Transparency Act (title LXIV of division F of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (Public Law 116–283; 134 Stat. 4604)); and
