Grant sought and received permission from Congress pursuant to a joint resolution to accept the Statue of Liberty on behalf of the United States as a gift from the government of France;Whereas, in 1896, Congress passed a joint resolution explicitly authorizing President Benjamin Harrison to accept medals presented to him by the governments of Brazil and Spain;Whereas President John F. Kennedy declined to accept honorary Irish citizenship in 1963, in order to avoid violating even the spirit of the Foreign Emoluments Clause;Whereas President Donald Trump, through the Department of Defense, intends to accept a Boeing 747–8 aircraft that has been described as a flying palace with an estimated value of at least $400,000,000 for temporary use as a Presidential transport aircraft during his term in office from the royal family of Qatar;Whereas ownership of this flying palace will reportedly transfer to President Trump’s personal Presidential library foundation no later than January 1, 2029;Whereas President Trump stated at a news conference on May 12, 2025, when asked about this reported offer by the royal family of Qatar to donate the aircraft, I would never be one to turn down that kind of an offer...I could be a stupid person and say, no, we don’t want a free, very expensive airplane;Whereas acceptance of the Qatari aircraft without the permission of Congress would clearly violate the Foreign Emoluments Clause, while also posing significant national security dangers, including, not only in terms of the corruption and illegitimate influence that the framers anticipated, but also in terms of substantial additional risks of espionage against and surveillance of the President and other senior United States Government officials; andWhereas President Trump remarked that this unprecedented and extravagant gift from a foreign state would result in big savings [that] will be spent, instead, to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!, but, in fact, it would not replace the existing contract for retrofitting and modernizing Air Force One, and would instead require hundreds of millions or billions of dollars in new Federal Government and taxpayer investment to retrofit and debug this gift from an autocratic foreign state: Now, therefore, be itThat it is the sense of the House of Representatives that President Trump must comply with the Foreign Emoluments Clause by—(1)submitting all plans for this gift immediately to Congress; and(2)if he wishes to accept the flying palace from the royal family of Qatar as he says publicly he would like to do, obtaining the consent of Congress before doing so, as have all of his predecessors in the Presidency in comparable circumstances.
