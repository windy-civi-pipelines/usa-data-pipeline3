Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the LGBTQ+ Panic Defense Prohibition Act of 2025.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds that—(1)the American Bar Association has urged the Federal Government to take legislative action to curtail the availability and effectiveness of legal defenses that seek to partially or completely excuse crimes such as murder and assault on the grounds that the sexual orientation or gender identity or expression of the victim was provocation enough for the violent reaction of the defendant;(2)panic defenses based on sexual orientation or gender identity or expression, which continue to be raised in criminal proceedings in Federal courts across the United States, are surprisingly long-lived historical artifacts, remnants of a time when widespread public antipathy was the norm for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (referred to in this Act as LGBTQ) individuals;(3)panic defenses based on sexual orientation or gender identity or expression characterize sexual orientation and gender identity or expression as objectively reasonable excuses for loss of self-control, and thereby illegitimately mitigate the responsibility of a perpetrator for harm done to LGBTQ individuals;(4)panic defenses based on sexual orientation or gender identity or expression appeal to irrational fears and hatred of LGBTQ individuals, thereby undermining the legitimacy of Federal criminal prosecutions and resulting in unjustifiable acquittals or sentencing reductions;(5)the use of panic defenses based on sexual orientation or gender identity or expression is entirely incompatible with the express intent of Federal law to provide increased protection to victims of bias-motivated crimes, including crimes committed against LGBTQ individuals;(6)continued use of these anachronistic defenses reinforces and institutionalizes prejudice at the expense of norms of self-control, tolerance, and compassion, which the law should encourage, and marks an egregious lapse in the march of the United States toward a more just criminal justice system; and(7)to end the antiquated notion that LGBTQ lives are worth less than others and to reflect modern understanding of LGBTQ individuals as equal citizens under law, panic defenses based on sexual orientation or gender identity or expression must end.
