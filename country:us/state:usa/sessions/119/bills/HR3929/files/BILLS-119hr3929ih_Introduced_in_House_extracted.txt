Section 1:
1.Short title
 This Act may be cited as the Giving Alien Migrants Back through Lawful Excise Redistribution Act or the GAMBLER Act.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds as follows: (1)Bold and decisive action must be undertaken to make America safe again, by protecting communities from the harms of illegal migration. 

        (2)
 The cost of making America safe again—apprehending, detaining, and deporting illegal aliens—should not fall on average American citizens.
       
(3)The Department of Justice reports the average cost to house an illegal alien is more than $150 per day, with an average detention time of 55 days prior to deportation. (4)The record $4.25 billion appropriated to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for alien detention and removal operations in fiscal year 2024 was not sufficient to keep up with the surge of aliens. 
(5)Congressional Budget Office estimates show that outlays for benefits provided to aliens and their children will total $177 billion by fiscal year 2034 if we do not change course. (6)Illegal migration has cost American citizens enough already; we must seek innovative ways to fund the process of apprehension, detention, and deportation without raising taxes.
