or(2)the inducement of a commercial sex act by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the individual induced to perform that act is younger than 18 years of age;Whereas forced labor and human trafficking generates revenues of at least $150,000,000,000 annually worldwide, and there are an estimated 50,000,000 victims of human trafficking and modern slavery across the globe;Whereas victims of human trafficking are difficult to identify and are subject to manipulation, force, fraud, coercion, and abuse;Whereas children and youths experiencing homelessness are particularly vulnerable and susceptible to manipulation, making them a prime target for the lucrative criminal industry of human trafficking;Whereas the Department of Justice has reported that human trafficking and modern slavery has been reported and investigated in each of the 50 States and the District of Columbia;Whereas the Department of State has reported that the top 3 countries of origin of federally-identified human trafficking victims in the United States in fiscal year 2021 were the United States, Mexico, and Honduras;Whereas, to help businesses in the United States combat child labor and forced labor in global supply chains, the Department of Labor has identified 159 goods from 78 countries that are made by child labor and forced labor;Whereas, since 2007, the National Human Trafficking Hotline has identified 100,891 instances of human trafficking involving 197,000 victims;Whereas there are known risk factors that contribute to youths running away, including domestic violence, child sexual abuse, and neglect, and runaway youths who experience homelessness are potential targets for human trafficking;Whereas, in 2024, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children received over 27,800 reports of possible child sex trafficking;Whereas, of the more than 29,000 missing children reported to National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in 2024, 1 in 7 was likely a victim of child sex trafficking;Whereas today, the average age of child sex trafficking victims reported missing to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children is only 15 years old;Whereas youth experiencing homelessness experience high rates of human trafficking, and 1 in 5 homeless youths is a victim of sex trafficking, labor trafficking, or both;Whereas 22 percent of youths who experience homelessness were approached for paid sex on their first night of homelessness;Whereas LGBTQ youth are at higher risk of becoming sex trafficking victims than their peers;Whereas youths facing homelessness have a lower probability of being trafficked if they have a supportive adult in their life;Whereas the Administration for Native Americans of the Department of Health and Human Services reports that American Indian, Alaska Native, and Pacific Islander women and girls have a heightened risk for sex trafficking;Whereas the Department of Justice found that studies on the topic of human trafficking of American Indians and Alaska Natives suggest there are—(1)high rates of sexual exploitation of Native women and girls;(2)gaps in data and research on trafficking of American Indian and Alaska Native victims;

and(2)dedicated to stopping the horrific enterprises of human trafficking and modern slavery;Whereas the United States should hold accountable all individuals, groups, organizations, governments, and countries that support, advance, or commit acts of human trafficking and modern slavery;Whereas, through education, the United States must also work to end human trafficking and modern slavery in all forms in the United States and around the world;Whereas victims of human trafficking deserve a trauma-informed approach that integrates the pursuit of justice and provision of social services designed to help them escape, and recover from, the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual trauma they endured;Whereas combating human trafficking requires a whole-of-government effort that rests on a unified and coordinated response among Federal, State, Tribal, and local agencies and that places equal value on the prevention of trafficking, the identification and stabilization of victims, and the investigation and prosecution of traffickers;Whereas laws to prosecute perpetrators of human trafficking and to assist and protect victims of human trafficking and modern slavery have been enacted in the United States, including—(1)the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7101 et seq.);(2)title XII of the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 (Public Law 113–4;
