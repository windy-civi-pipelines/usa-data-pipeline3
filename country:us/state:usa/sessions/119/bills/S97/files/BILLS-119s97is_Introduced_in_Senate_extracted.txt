Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Securing Semiconductor Supply Chains Act.

Section 2:
2.SelectUSA definedIn this Act, the term SelectUSA means the SelectUSA program of the Department of Commerce established by Executive Order 13577 (76 Fed. Reg. 35715).

Section 3:
3.FindingsCongress makes the following findings:(1)Semiconductors underpin the United States and global economies, including manufacturing sectors. Semiconductors are also essential to the national security of the United States.(2)A shortage of semiconductors, brought about by the COVID–19 pandemic and other complex factors impacting the overall supply chain, has threatened the economic recovery of the United States and industries that employ millions of United States citizens.(3)Addressing current challenges and building resilience against future risks requires ensuring a secure and stable supply chain for semiconductors that will support the economic and national security needs of the United States and its allies.(4)The supply chain for semiconductors is complex and global. While the United States plays a leading role in certain segments of the semiconductor industry, securing the supply chain requires onshoring, reshoring, or diversifying vulnerable segments, such as for—(A)fabrication;(B)advanced packaging; and(C)materials and equipment used to manufacture semiconductor products.(5)The Federal Government can leverage foreign direct investment and private dollars to grow the domestic manufacturing and production capacity of the United States for vulnerable segments of the semiconductor supply chain.(6)The SelectUSA program of the Department of Commerce, in coordination with other Federal agencies and State-level economic development organizations, is positioned to boost foreign direct investment in domestic manufacturing and to help secure the semiconductor supply chain of the United States.

Section 4:

Section 5:
5.Report on increasing foreign direct investment in semiconductor-related manufacturing and productionNot later than 2 years after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Executive Director of SelectUSA, in coordination with the Federal Interagency Investment Working Group established by Executive Order 13577 (76 Fed.
