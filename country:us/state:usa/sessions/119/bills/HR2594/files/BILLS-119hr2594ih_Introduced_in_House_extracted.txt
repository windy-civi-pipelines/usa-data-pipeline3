(2)Covered water systemThe term covered water system means— (A)a community water system (as defined in section 1401 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300f)) that serves a population of 3,300 or more persons; or 
(B)a treatment works (as defined in section 212 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1292)) that serves a population of 3,300 or more persons. (3)Cyber resilient (A)In generalThe term cyber resilient means the ability of a covered water system to withstand or reduce the magnitude or duration of cybersecurity incidents that disrupt the ability of the covered water system to function normally. 
(B)InclusionThe term cyber resilient includes the ability of a covered water system to anticipate, absorb, adapt to, or rapidly recover from cybersecurity incidents. (4)Cybersecurity incidentThe term cybersecurity incident means a malicious act or suspicious event that disrupts, or attempts to disrupt, the operation of programmable electronic devices and communication networks, including hardware, software, and data that are essential to the cyber resilient operation of a covered water system. 
(5)Cybersecurity risk and resilience requirementThe term cybersecurity risk and resilience requirement means a requirement that provides for the cyber resilient operation of a covered water system and the cyber resilient design of planned additions or modifications to a covered water system. (6)Water risk and resilience organization; wrroThe terms Water Risk and Resilience Organization and WRRO mean the organization certified by the Administrator under subsection (c). 
(b)ApplicabilityNot later than 270 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall issue a final rule to carry out this section, including regulations for the selection and certification of the WRRO under subsection (c).  (c)Certification (1)In generalFollowing the issuance of the final rule under subsection (b)(1), any organization may submit an application to the Administrator, at such time, in such manner, and containing such information as the Administrator may require, for certification as the Water Risk and Resilience Organization. 
(2)RequirementsThe Administrator shall certify not more than 1 organization that submitted an application under paragraph (1) as the Water Risk and Resilience Organization if the Administrator determines that the organization— (A)demonstrates advanced technical knowledge and expertise in the operations of covered water systems; 
(B)is comprised of 1 or more members with relevant experience as owners or operators of covered water systems; (C)has demonstrated the ability to develop and implement cybersecurity risk and resilience requirements that provide for an adequate level of cybersecurity risk and resilience for a covered water system; 
(D)is capable of establishing measures, in line with prevailing best practices, to secure sensitive information and to protect sensitive security information from public disclosure; and (E)has established rules that— 
(i)require that the organization be independent of the users, owners, and operators of a covered water system, with balanced and objective stakeholder representation in the selection of directors of the organization and balanced decision making in any committee or subordinate organizational structure; (ii)require that the organization allocate reasonable dues, fees, and other charges among end-users for all activities under this section; 
(iii)provide just and reasonable procedures for enforcement of cybersecurity risk and resilience requirements and the imposition of penalties in accordance with subsection (f), including limitations on activities, functions, or operations, or other appropriate sanctions; and (iv)provides for reasonable notice and opportunity for public comment, due process, openness, and balancing of interests in developing cybersecurity risk and resilience requirements and otherwise exercising duties described in this section.

(1)In general 
(A)Proposed requirementsThe WRRO shall file with the Administrator each cybersecurity risk and resilience requirement or modification to such a requirement that the WRRO proposes to be made effective under this section. (B)Implementation plan (i)In generalFor each proposed cybersecurity risk and resilience requirement or modification to such a requirement filed pursuant to subparagraph (A), the WRRO shall file an implementation plan, including the schedule for implementation, which may include a specified date, by which covered water systems shall achieve compliance with all of the cybersecurity risk and resilience requirement or modification to such a requirement. The implementation schedule may account for a phased rollout of the requirement, recognizing that the requirement may not apply, in totality, to all covered water systems. 
(ii)Reasonable deadlinesThe enforcement date proposed by the WRRO in the implementation plan under clause (i) shall provide a reasonable implementation period for covered water systems to meet the requirements under the implementation plan. (2)Approval (A)In generalNotwithstanding paragraph (3)(A), the Administrator shall approve a proposed cybersecurity risk and resilience requirement or modification to such a requirement, including the accompanying implementation plan filed under paragraph (1), if the Administrator determines that the requirement is just, reasonable, and not unduly discriminatory or preferential. 
(B)Deference to wrroThe Administrator shall defer to the technical expertise of the WRRO with respect to the content of a proposed cybersecurity risk and resilience requirement or modification to such a requirement. (3)Disapproval of requirement (A)In generalNotwithstanding paragraph (2)(A), if the Administrator disapproves, in whole or in part, a filed cybersecurity risk and resilience requirement or modification to such a requirement, the Administrator shall remand such requirement to the WRRO and provide to the WRRO specific recommendations that would lead to the approval of the cybersecurity risk and resilience requirement or modification to such requirement under paragraph (2). 
(B)TimelineThe Administrator shall remand to the WRRO a proposed cybersecurity risk and resilience requirement or modification to such a requirement disapproved under subparagraph (A), including the submission of the specific recommendations required under that subparagraph, not later than 90 days after the date on which the WRRO filed the requirement or modification with the Administrator under paragraph (1)(A). (C)Response and approval (i)In generalOn receipt of the remand of a proposed cybersecurity risk and resilience requirement or modification to such a requirement and receipt of the specific recommendations of the Administrator pursuant to subparagraph (A), the WRRO shall— 
(I)accept the recommendations of the Administrator and resubmit an amended proposed cybersecurity risk and resilience requirement or modification to such a requirement consistent with those recommendations; (II)provide to the Administrator and a reason why the recommendation was not accepted; or 
(III)withdraw the proposed cybersecurity risk and resilience requirement or modification to such a requirement. (ii)Amended requirementIf the WRRO files an amended proposed cybersecurity risk and resilience requirement or modification to such a requirement under clause (i)(I) the Administrator shall review such proposed requirement or modification and determine whether to approve such amended requirement or modification in accordance with paragraph (2)(A). 
(iii)Response by WRROOn receipt of a response from the WRRO pursuant to clause (i)(II), the Administrator shall— (I)approve the proposed cybersecurity risk and resilience requirement or modification to such a requirement; or 
(II)invite the WRRO to engage in negotiations with the Administrator to reach consensus to address the specific recommendation made by the Administrator under subparagraph (A).
