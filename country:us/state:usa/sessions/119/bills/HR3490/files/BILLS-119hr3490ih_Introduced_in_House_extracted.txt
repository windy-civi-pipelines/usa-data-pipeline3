2.
      Findings
 Congress finds that—  (1) esophageal cancer is the fastest increasing cancer among American men;
      
      
        (2)
 esophageal cancer is one of the fastest growing cancer diagnoses among all Americans, increasing more than 700 percent in recent decades;
      
      
        (3)
 esophageal cancer kills 1 American every 36 minutes every day;   (4) esophageal cancer is among the deadliest of cancers, with only about 1 in 5 patients surviving 5 years;
      
      
        (5)
 esophageal cancer has tripled in incidence among younger Americans in recent decades;
      
      
        (6)
 esophageal cancer has low survival rates because it is usually discovered at advanced stages when treatment outcomes are poor;
      
      
        (7)
 raising awareness about esophageal cancer empowers individuals to seek preventive care, recognize symptoms, and pursue early detection strategies;
      
      
        (8)
 survivors, caregivers, medical professionals, and researchers have made tremendous strides in advancing treatment options and improving the quality of life for those affected by the disease;
      
      
        (9)
 esophageal cancer can be prevented through early detection of its precursor, Barrett’s esophagus, which can be eliminated with curative outpatient techniques;
      
      
        (10)
 research indicates that patients diagnosed with early-stage esophageal cancer have a significantly higher 5-year survival rate (as high as 49 percent) compared to those diagnosed at later stages, underscoring the critical need for enhanced screening and awareness; and
      
      
        (11)
 as of December 2022, the American Gastroenterological Association recommends screening with a standard upper endoscopy in individuals with 3 or more established risk factors for Barrett’s Esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma, including—
        
          (A)
 male sex;   (B) non-Hispanic white ethnicity;
        
        
          (C)
 age of 50 years or older;   (D) a history of smoking, chronic gastrointestinal reflux disease, or obesity; and
        
        
          (E)
 a family history of Barrett’s Esophagus or esophageal adenocarcinoma.

Section 3:
3. GAO report Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall submit a report to Congress that includes an evaluation of—
      
        (1)
 the total impact of esophageal cancer-related health care spending under the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program for Federal employees and retirees diagnosed with esophageal cancer; and
      
      
        (2)
 how often individuals covered under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program with medical records indicating such individuals are high-risk for esophageal cancer undergo screening according to the established guidelines.
