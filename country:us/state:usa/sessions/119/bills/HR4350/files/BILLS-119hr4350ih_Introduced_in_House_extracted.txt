(4)Meetings and collective bargaining agreementsNot later than 10 days after an employer receiving funding under this section receives a written request for collective bargaining from a recognized or certified labor organization representing employees who perform or will perform work funded by a loan provided under this section, or within such period as the parties agree upon, the labor organization and employer shall meet and commence to bargain collectively and shall make every reasonable effort to conclude such bargaining and sign a collective bargaining agreement.
(5)Mediation and conciliationIf, after the expiration of the 90-day period beginning on the date on which collective bargaining under paragraph (4) began, or such additional period as the parties may agree upon, the parties have failed to reach an agreement, either party may notify the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (referred to in this subsection as the Service) of the existence of a dispute and request mediation. Whenever such a request is received, it shall be the duty of the Service promptly to put itself in communication with the parties and to use its best efforts, by mediation and conciliation, to bring them to agreement. (6)Tripartite arbitration (A)In generalIf, after the expiration of the 30-day period beginning on the date on which the request for mediation is made under paragraph (5), or such additional period as the parties may agree upon, the Service is not able to bring the parties to agreement by mediation and conciliation, the Service shall refer the dispute to a tripartite arbitration panel established in accordance with such regulations as may be prescribed by the Service.
(B)MembersA tripartite arbitration panel established under this clause with respect to a dispute shall be composed of 1 member selected by the labor organization, 1 member selected by the employer, and 1 neutral member mutually agreed to by the labor organization and the employer. Each such member shall be selected not later than 14 days after the expiration of the 30-day period described in subparagraph (A) with respect to such dispute. Any member not so selected by the date that is 14 days after the expiration of such period shall be selected by the Service.

(1)In generalNotwithstanding any other provision of law, including the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 151 et seq.), this subsection shall apply to any recipient of a loan under this section who is an employer and any labor organization who represents or seeks to represent any employees or only those employees who perform or will perform work funded by a loan provided under this section. (2)RecognitionAny employer receiving a loan under this section shall recognize for purposes of collective bargaining a labor organization that demonstrates that a majority of the employees in a unit appropriate for such purposes and who perform or will perform work funded by a loan provided under this section have signed valid authorizations designating the labor organization as their collective bargaining representative and that no other labor organization is certified or recognized pursuant to section 9 of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 159) as the exclusive representative of any of the employees in the unit who perform or will perform such work. Upon such showing of majority status, the employer shall notify the labor organization and the National Labor Relations Board that the employer—
(A)has determined that the labor organization represents a majority of the employees in such unit who perform or will perform such work; and (B)is recognizing the labor organization as the exclusive representative of the employees in such unit who perform or will perform such work for the purposes of collective bargaining pursuant to that section.
 (3) Dispute resolution and unit certification If a dispute over majority status or the appropriateness of the unit described in paragraph (2) arises between the employer and the labor organization, either party may request that the National Labor Relations Board investigate and resolve the dispute. If the Board finds that a majority of the employees in a unit appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining who perform or will perform work funded by a loan provided under this section have signed valid authorizations designating the labor organization as their representative for such purposes and that no other individual or labor organization is certified or recognized as the exclusive representative of any of the employees in the unit who perform or will perform such work for such purposes, the Board shall not direct an election but shall certify the labor organization as the representative described in section 9(a) of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 159(a)).  (4)Meetings and collective bargaining agreementsNot later than 10 days after an employer receiving funding under this section receives a written request for collective bargaining from a recognized or certified labor organization representing employees who perform or will perform work funded by a loan provided under this section, or within such period as the parties agree upon, the labor organization and employer shall meet and commence to bargain collectively and shall make every reasonable effort to conclude such bargaining and sign a collective bargaining agreement.
(5)Mediation and conciliationIf, after the expiration of the 90-day period beginning on the date on which collective bargaining under paragraph (4) began, or such additional period as the parties may agree upon, the parties have failed to reach an agreement, either party may notify the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (referred to in this subsection as the Service) of the existence of a dispute and request mediation. Whenever such a request is received, it shall be the duty of the Service promptly to put itself in communication with the parties and to use its best efforts, by mediation and conciliation, to bring them to agreement. (6)Tripartite arbitration (A)In generalIf, after the expiration of the 30-day period beginning on the date on which the request for mediation is made under paragraph (5), or such additional period as the parties may agree upon, the Service is not able to bring the parties to agreement by mediation and conciliation, the Service shall refer the dispute to a tripartite arbitration panel established in accordance with such regulations as may be prescribed by the Service.
(B)MembersA tripartite arbitration panel established under this clause with respect to a dispute shall be composed of 1 member selected by the labor organization, 1 member selected by the employer, and 1 neutral member mutually agreed to by the labor organization and the employer. Each such member shall be selected not later than 14 days after the expiration of the 30-day period described in subparagraph (A) with respect to such dispute. Any member not so selected by the date that is 14 days after the expiration of such period shall be selected by the Service. (C)DecisionsA majority of a tripartite arbitration panel established under this clause with respect to a dispute shall render a decision settling the dispute as soon as practicable, and (absent extraordinary circumstances or by agreement or permission of the parties) not later than 120 days after the establishment of such panel. Such a decision shall be binding upon the parties for a period of 2 years, unless amended during such period by written consent of the parties. Such decision shall be based on—
(i)the financial status and prospects of the employer; (ii)the size and type of the operations and business of the employer;
(iii)the cost of living of the employees; (iv)the ability of the employees to sustain themselves, their families, and their dependents on the wages and benefits they earn from the employer; and
