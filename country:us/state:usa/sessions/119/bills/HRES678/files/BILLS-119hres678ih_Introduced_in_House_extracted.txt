IV119th CONGRESS1st SessionH. RES. 678IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESSeptember 4, 2025Mr. Van Drew submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Education and WorkforceRESOLUTIONExpressing support for the month of September as Founding Fathers’ Month.
Whereas the Founding Fathers of the United States, including but not limited to George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, James Madison, John Jay, Alexander Hamilton, Patrick Henry, John Hancock, George Mason, Gouverneur Morris, John Marshall, and Samuel Adams, were an extraordinary group of leaders who, against all odds, secured independence from the British Empire and were instrumental in shaping the foundational principles of American democracy; Whereas the Founding Fathers contributed nobly through their service on the battlefield, intellectual debates, through compromise and negotiation, and the drafting of key founding documents, pledging their lives, fortunes, and sacred honor to the cause of American independence and the establishment of a just and lasting governance;
Whereas the month of September holds historical significance in the history of the United States, as it marks the signing of the Constitution on September 17, 1787; Whereas the beginning of the school year in September presents a timely opportunity to educate students on the history, contributions, and enduring significance of the Founding Fathers and the principles they fought to establish; and
Whereas there is a concerning decline in knowledge about the Founding Fathers and the foundational principles of the Republic among both children and adults, as well as a significant decline in patriotism and civic engagement: Now, therefore, be it That the House of Representatives—
(1)supports a Founding Fathers’ Month; (2)encourages all Americans to take the opportunity to honor the Founding Fathers and their contributions to the Nation’s independence and system of governance;
(3)urges educational institutions, public organizations, and government entities to participate in efforts that promote awareness, education, and appreciation of the Founding Fathers, with the goal of fostering a greater understanding of American liberty and the responsibilities of being an American citizen; (4)calls upon the Department of Education to support programs, resources, and activities that help ensure the survival of the Republic by deepening the Nation’s understanding of its founding principles and the vital role of civic education; and
(5)supports a Founding Fathers’ Month as a time to reflect on the sacrifices made by the Founding Fathers and to commit to preserving the freedoms they fought to establish for future generations.
