Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Frontline Fighter Force First Act.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress makes the following findings:(1)Ensuring that the United States military remains the strongest fighting force in the world requires a highly mission capable frontline fighter fleet across fourth, fifth, and next-generation platforms.(2)In particular, fighter wings that deploy at least 50 percent of the time, including the 335th operational squadron at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, are on the frontlines of the fight for freedom.(3)At the same time, with declining mission capable rates, including 55 percent for the F–15E fleet, prioritizing recapitalization of legacy aircraft with aging equipment and engines like the Block 220 F–15Es must be a priority for the U.S. Air Force. By recapitalizing active-duty bases with upgraded fourth generation aircraft like the F–15EX to replace the legacy fleet, the U.S. can fulfill its mission to sustain optimal mission readiness.(4)Further, that recognizing the historical contributions of Strike Eagle aircraft at a time when they continue to deliver unmatched payload capability and range in active theaters, including CENTCOM, is a high congressional priority.(5)F–15E aircraft can carry up to 12 unique missiles, an unrivaled combination of heavy payload and long range with stealth capability.(6)Since their first combat flight, F–15Es boast an undefeated 104–0 winning record in Air-to-Air missions across the Persian Gulf, Iraqi, and counterterrorism operations in the CENTCOM AOR.(7)During the Iraq War, F–15E Strike Eagles from Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in Goldsboro, North Carolina, played a significant role, deploying for Operation Iraqi Freedom.(8)Then, on April 13, 2024, with only 24 hours to prepare ahead of an unprecedented ballistic missile attack from Iran, airmen from the 335th operational squadron, under command of the 4th Fighter Wing based at Seymour Johnson deployed in four F–15Es that alone intercepted more than two dozen of the one-way attack drones fired at Israel and U.S. military personnel based in the region. They defended our coalition partners, including Israel, embodying the true essence of service.(9)To commemorate their courage, General Ken Wilsbach, commander of Air Combat Command, awarded airmen from the 4th Fighter Wing high-level decorations during a ceremony at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base. The airmen were recognized for their rapid response and valiant performance in the largest air-to-air engagement in over 50 years. Those heroes, receiving well-deserved decorations and surrounded by their families, have rightfully earned our nation’s deep gratitude. To fighter pilots, maintainers, and all airmen that keep the F–15E fleet alive and well, Congress must continue to uplift the power of the E platform, including upgraded F–15EX fighters.
