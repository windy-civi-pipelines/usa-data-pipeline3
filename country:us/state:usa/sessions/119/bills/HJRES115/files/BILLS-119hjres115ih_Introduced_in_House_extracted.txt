IA119th CONGRESS1st SessionH. J. RES. 115IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESAugust 15, 2025Mr. Raskin (for himself, Ms. Norton, and Mr. Garcia of California) submitted the following joint resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Oversight and Government ReformJOINT RESOLUTIONTerminating the emergency determined by the President on August 11, 2025, in the Executive Order titled Declaring a crime emergency in the District of Columbia. 
Whereas the President has failed to identify special conditions of an emergency nature that compel the use of the Metropolitan Police Department for Federal purposes in the District of Columbia;  Whereas, even if properly invoked for an actual emergency, section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act does not empower the President to federalize the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD), but rather limits the President to directing the Mayor to provide him with the use of MPD’s services to carry out specific Federal purposes;
     
Whereas violent crime in the District of Columbia has declined for the past two years and currently stands at a 30-year low; and  Whereas the Federal Government, in 2025, has prevented the District of Columbia from spending $1 billion of its own locally-raised revenues—money that was budgeted for essential public safety purposes, including law enforcement, fire and emergency response services, and schools: Now, therefore, be it
    
    
 That pursuant to section 740(b) of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act (sec. 1–207.40(b), D.C. Official Code), the emergency determined by the President on August 11, 2025, in the Executive Order titled Declaring a crime emergency in the District of Columbia is hereby terminated.
