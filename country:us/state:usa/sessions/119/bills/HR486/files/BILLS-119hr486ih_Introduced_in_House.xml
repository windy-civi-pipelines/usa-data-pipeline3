This is especially true for young people as they are earning their first paychecks, securing student aid, and establishing their financial independence. Therefore, focusing economic education and financial literacy efforts and best practices for young people between the ages of 8–24 is of the utmost importance.</text></paragraph></section><section id="H06139F17A8F34C5C8E03E6A3FA16C660"><enum>3.</enum><header>Authorization for funding the establishment of centers of excellence in financial literacy education</header><subsection id="HAE2E47AE79534F0F8CD3E5CE590B4AEC"><enum>(a)</enum><header>In general</header><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (<external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/12/5481">12 U.S.C. 5481 et seq.</external-xref>) is amended—</text><paragraph id="H91206F5479994727BC097C22D50228F9"><enum>(1)</enum><text>by redesignating section 1037 as section 1038;
