Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Young Americans Financial Literacy Act.

Section 2:
2.FindingsThe Congress finds as follows:(1)That 88 percent of Americans believe financial education should be taught in schools and 92 percent of K–12 teachers believe that financial education should be taught in school, but only 12 percent of teachers actually teach the subject.(2)According to a 2020 survey, less than half of states require high school students to take a course on personal finance, and less than 17 percent of high schoolers were required to take a one semester personal finance course.(3)For the fourth year in a row, more than one third of surveyed consumers gave themselves a B when grading their own level of basic financial literacy. Less than one-fifth of Americans gave themselves an A. Most adults feel that their financial literacy skills are inadequate, yet they do not rely on anyone else to handle their finances; they feel it is important to know more but have received no financial education.(4)The sudden disruptions caused by the spread of COVID–19 are presenting economic challenges with growing consequences. While some factors affecting financial well-being are beyond individual control, financial literacy can help people better manage their finances through times of hardship.(5)It is necessary to respond immediately to the pressing needs of individuals faced with the loss of their financial stability; however increased attention must also be paid to financial literacy education reform and long-term solutions to prevent future personal financial disasters.(6)There is an urgent need to respond to the COVID–19 economic recovery with research-based financial literacy education programs to reach individuals at all ages and socioeconomic levels, particularly those facing unique and challenging financial situations, such as high school graduates entering the workforce, soon-to-be and recent college graduates, young families, and the unique needs of military personnel and their families.(7)High school and college students who are exposed to cumulative financial education show an increase in financial knowledge, which in turn drives increasingly responsible behavior as they become young adults.(8)The majority (52 percent) of young adults between the ages of 23–28 consider making better choices about managing money, the single most important issue for individual Americans to act on today.(9)According to the Government Accountability Office, giving Americans the information they need to make effective financial decisions can be key to their well-being and to the country’s economic health. The current pandemic, in which 88 percent of Americans say is causing stress on their personal finances, underscores the need to improve individuals’ financial literacy and empower all Americans to make informed financial decisions. This is especially true for young people as they are earning their first paychecks, securing student aid, and establishing their financial independence. Therefore, focusing economic education and financial literacy efforts and best practices for young people between the ages of 8–24 is of the utmost importance.
