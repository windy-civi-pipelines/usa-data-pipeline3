                (3)
 effective wildfire management requires interagency, cross-boundary, strategic, and holistic solutions;
            
            
                (4)
 relevant Federal, State, Tribal, and local governments should be included in any planning, decision-making, or response activities with respect to wildfire management;
            
            
                (5)
 a purpose of a quadrennial fire review is—  (A) to forecast conditions that may present the greatest challenges for wildland fire management throughout the 20-year period immediately following such review; and
                
                
                    (B)
 to inform the development of long-term, strategic actions to address such challenges;
                
            
            
                (6)
 the report of the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior entitled The National Strategy: the Final Phase in the Development of the National Cohesive Wildland Fire Management Strategy (April 2014), as updated by the report entitled National Cohesive Wildland Fire Management Strategy Addendum Update (January 2023), represents a strategic, collaborative effort to address wildfire management in all landscapes and using the best science available to make meaningful progress toward the 3 goals established in such report regarding—
                
                    (A)
 resilient landscapes;   (B) fire-adapted communities; and
                
                
                    (C)
 safe and effective wildfire response; and    (7) the report of the Wildland Fire Mitigation and Management Commission entitled ON FIRE: The Report of the Wildland Fire Mitigation and Management Commission (September 2023) presents a consensus set of recommendations developed by 50 diverse experts and intended to result in improved outcomes for wildfire management in the United States.
