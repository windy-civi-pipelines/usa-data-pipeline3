In 2018, the State experienced 15 major fires leading up to Election Day. These fires displaced voters, burned residences, and damaged polling stations. Climate change has extended wildfire season in the American west into the late Fall: On November 8, 2018, just two days after Election Day, the Camp Fire ignited, eventually claiming 85 lives and destroying over 18,000 structures—the deadliest fire in California history. Evacuation orders because of wildfires displace hundreds of thousands of voters each year, well into the days leading up to the election.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HD0AFFDD1F10943DFB5C9F1AA0C4D6414"><enum>(6)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">In 2018, Hurricane Michael hit the Florida panhandle just 27 days before the midterm elections, causing at least 16 deaths, damaging or destroying an estimated 40,000 homes, and resulting in approximately $25 billion in damages.
