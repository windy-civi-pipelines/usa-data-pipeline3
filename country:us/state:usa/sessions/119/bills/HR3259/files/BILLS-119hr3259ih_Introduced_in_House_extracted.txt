(A)disseminating and making publicly available guidance and resources to help organizations adopt and deploy post-quantum cryptography standards; (B)providing technical assistance, as practicable, to entities that are high risk of quantum cryptoanalytic attacks, such as entities determined to be critical infrastructure or digital infrastructure providers; and
(C)conducting such other activities as determined necessary by the Director to promote the adoption and deployment of post-quantum cryptography standards across the United States. (2)Grant program (A)In generalSubject to the availability of appropriations and after the date on which the Director of National Institute of Standards and Technology has issued post-quantum cryptography standards under paragraph (1), the Director may establish a program to identify and provide technical assistance through the award of grants to entities that are at high risk of quantum cryptoanalytic attacks, including by granting funds, in adopting such post-quantum cryptographic standards and remediating quantum-related vulnerabilities.
(B)Use of fundsGrants awarded to entities under this subsection may be used to cover reasonable costs, up to a specified amount established by the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, of activities to adopt post-quantum cryptographic standards and remediate quantum-related vulnerabilities. (C)GuidanceThe Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology may develop, and periodically update, guidance, including eligibility, application disclosure requirements, grant amount and duration, and any additional requirements regarding the award of grants under this paragraph.
(D)ConsultationIf the program described in this paragraph is established, the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology shall consult with the Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency of the Department of Homeland Security, the heads of other Sector Specific Agencies and risk management agencies, and appropriate representatives of private sector entities, including nonprofit organizations, to share information regarding the program and guidance developed under subparagraph (C).. (b)National Science Foundation cryptography researchSubsection (a)(1)(A) of section 4 of the Cyber Security Research and Development Act (15 U.S.C. 7403) is amended by inserting , including post-quantum cryptography before the semicolon.
