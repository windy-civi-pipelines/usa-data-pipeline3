Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Forage Fish Conservation Act of 2025.

Section 2:
2.FindingsSection 2(a) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801(a)) is amended by adding at the end the following: 
 
(14)Forage fish are generally small to intermediate-sized species, occurring in schools or dense aggregations, and function as a main pathway for energy to flow from phyto- and zooplankton to higher trophic level predators, including tuna, Alaska pollock, and other wildlife, in marine ecosystems. While most species function as prey of others at some life stage, especially when small and young, forage fish maintain this important trophic role throughout their life. Further, fluctuations in their populations can result in significant changes in marine communities and ecosystems. Therefore, particular attention to management of forage fish species, and addressing their unique role in marine ecosystems, is critical to maintaining ecosystem function and sustainable fisheries..

Section 3:
3.Definitions  (a) Secretary To define forage fish Section 305 of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1855) is amended by adding at the end the following:
        
          
            (l)
            Forage fish
 Not later than 12 months after the date of the enactment of the Forage Fish Conservation Act of 2025, the Secretary, with advice from the Councils, shall issue a definition of the term forage fish for the purposes of this Act, giving due consideration to definitions of forage fish included in approved fishery management plans. In defining such term, the Secretary shall consider factors including whether a species covered by such definition, throughout the lifecycle of such species—
            
              (1)
 is at a low trophic level;   (2) is generally small- to intermediate-sized;
            
            
              (3)
 occurs in schools or other dense aggregations;   (4) contributes significantly to the diets of other fish, marine mammals, or birds; and
            
            
              (5)
 serves as a conduit for energy transfer to species at a higher trophic level.
            
          
          .

(4)by inserting after paragraph (18) the following:  (19)The term forage fish— 
(A)has the meaning given the term by the Secretary under section 305(l); and (B)with respect to a species in a fishery managed pursuant to a fishery management plan or plan amendment that is approved by the Secretary, in coordination with the Councils, under section 304(a), means any species identified in such plan as a forage fish.; and 
(5)by inserting after paragraph (28), as so redesignated by paragraph (3) of this section, the following:  (29)The term low trophic level means a position in the marine food web in which the fish generally consume plankton..

Section 4:
4.Scientific adviceSection 302(g)(1)(B) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1852(g)(1)(B)) is amended to read as follows:  (B)Each scientific and statistical committee shall provide its Council ongoing scientific advice for fishery management decisions, including recommendations for— 
(i)acceptable biological catch; (ii)preventing overfishing; 
(iii)maximum sustainable yield; (iv)achieving rebuilding targets; 
(v)maintaining a sufficient abundance, diversity, and localized distribution of forage fish populations to support their role in marine ecosystems; and (vi)reports on stock status and health, bycatch, habitat status, social and economic impacts of management measures, and sustainability of fishing practices..
