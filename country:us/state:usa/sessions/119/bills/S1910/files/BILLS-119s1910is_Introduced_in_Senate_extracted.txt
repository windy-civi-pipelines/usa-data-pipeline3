            Purpose and findings
            
                (a)
                Purpose
 The purpose of this Act is to provide young people with sex education and sexual health services that—
                
                    (1)
 promote and uphold the rights of young people to information and services that empower them to make decisions about their bodies, health, sexuality, families, and communities in all areas of life;
                
                
                    (2)
 are evidence-informed, comprehensive in scope, confidential, equitable, accessible, medically accurate and complete, age and developmentally appropriate, culturally responsive, trauma-informed and resilience-oriented, and align with the National Sex Education Standards of the Future of Sex Ed Initiative;
                
                
                    (3)

                    (7)

                (b)
                Findings
 Congress finds the following:  (1) Young people need and have the right to sex education and sexual health services that are evidence-informed, comprehensive in scope, confidential, equitable, accessible, medically accurate and complete, age and developmentally appropriate, culturally responsive, and trauma-informed and resilience-oriented.
                
                
                    (2)
 Currently, there is a gap between the sex education that young people should be receiving based on expert standards and the sex education many actually receive.
                
                
                    (3)
 Only 36 States and the District of Columbia mandate sex education or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) education in schools.
                
                
                    (4)
 When there is sex education or instruction regarding HIV or sexually transmitted infections (STI), 13 States do not require the content to be evidence-informed, medically accurate and complete, age and developmentally appropriate, or culturally responsive.
                
                
                    (5)
 Many sex education programs and sexual health services currently available were not designed to and do not currently meet the needs of underserved young people. Some such programs and services actually harm underserved young people.
                
                
                    (6)
 For underserved young people, a lack of comprehensive in scope, confidential, equitable, and accessible sex education and sexual health services is not unfamiliar, but rather a longstanding manifestation of white supremacy, which has touched every aspect of our history, culture, and institutions, including the education and health care systems.
                
                
                    (7)
 The development and delivery of sexual health education and sexual health services in the United States historically has been rooted in the oppression of Black, Indigenous, Latine, Asian American, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, and other People of Color.
                
                
                    (8)
 The United States has a long history of eugenics and forced sterilization. The sexual and reproductive rights and bodily autonomy of specific communities deemed undesirable or defective were targeted by our governments resulting in state-sanctioned violence and generations of trauma and oppression. These communities include—
                    
                        (A)
 people with low incomes;   (B) immigrants;
                    
                    
                        (C)
 people with disabilities;   (D) people living with HIV;
                    
                    
                        (E)
 survivors of interpersonal violence;   (F) people who are incarcerated, detained, or who otherwise have encountered the criminal-legal system;
                    
                    
                        (G)
 Black, Indigenous, Latine, Asian American, and other People of Color;
                    
                    
                        (H)
 people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer; and
                    
                    
                        (I)
 young people who are pregnant and parenting.    (9) Black young people are more likely to receive abstinence-only instruction. Research shows that abstinence-only instruction, also known as sexual risk avoidance instruction, is ineffective in comparison to comprehensive sex education.
                
                
                    (10)
 Black, Indigenous, and Latine young people are disproportionately more likely to be diagnosed with an STI, have an unintended pregnancy, or experience sexual assault.
                
                
                    (11)
 The framework of Reproductive Justice acknowledges and aims to address the legacy of white supremacy, systemic oppression, and the restrictions on sex education and sexual health services that disproportionately impact underserved communities. Reproductive Justice will be achieved when all people regardless of actual or perceived race, color, ethnicity, national origin, religion, immigration status, sex (including gender identity and sexual orientation), disability status, pregnancy or parenting status, or age have the power to make decisions about their bodies, health, sexuality, families, and communities in all areas of life.
                
                
                    (12)
 Increased resources are required for sex education and sexual health services to reach all young people, redress inequities and their impacts on underserved young people, and achieve Reproductive Justice for young people.
                
                
                    (13)
 Such sex education and sexual health services should—  (A) promote and uphold the rights of young people to information and services in order to make and exercise informed and responsible decisions about their sexual health;
                    
                    
                        (B)
 be evidence-informed, comprehensive in scope, confidential, equitable, accessible, age and developmentally appropriate, culturally responsive, and trauma-informed and resilience-oriented;
                    
                    
                        (C)
 include instruction and materials that address—  (i) puberty and adolescent development;
                        
                        
                            (ii)
 sexual and reproductive anatomy and physiology;   (iii) sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression;
                        
                        
                            (iv)
 contraception, pregnancy, and reproduction;   (v) HIV and other STIs;
                        
                        
                            (vi)
 consent and healthy relationships; and   (vii) interpersonal violence;
                        
                    
                    
                        (D)
 promote gender equity and be inclusive of young people with varying gender identities, gender expressions, and sexual orientations;
                    
                    
                        (E)
 promote safe and healthy relationships; and   (F) promote racial equity and be responsive to the needs of young people who are Black, Indigenous, and other People of Color.

            Mr. Booker (for himself, Ms. Hirono, Mr.
                    Padilla, Mr. Markey,

            1.
            Short title
 This Act may be cited as the Real Education and Access for Healthy Youth Act of 2025.
        
        
            2.
            Purpose and findings
            
                (a)
                Purpose
 The purpose of this Act is to provide young people with sex education and sexual health services that—
                
                    (1)
 promote and uphold the rights of young people to information and services that empower them to make decisions about their bodies, health, sexuality, families, and communities in all areas of life;
                
                
                    (2)
 are evidence-informed, comprehensive in scope, confidential, equitable, accessible, medically accurate and complete, age and developmentally appropriate, culturally responsive, trauma-informed and resilience-oriented, and align with the National Sex Education Standards of the Future of Sex Ed Initiative;
                
                
                    (3)
 provide information about the prevention, treatment, and care of pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections, and interpersonal violence;
                
                
                    (4)
 provide information about the importance of consent as a basis for healthy relationships and for autonomy in health care;
                
                
                    (5)
 provide information on gender identity and gender expression;   (6) provide information on the historical and current condition in which education and health systems, policies, programs, services, and practices have uniquely and adversely impacted Black, Indigenous, Latine, Asian American, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, and other People of Color; and
                
                
                    (7)
 redress inequities in the delivery of sex education and sexual health services to underserved young people.
                
            
            
                (b)
                Findings
 Congress finds the following:  (1) Young people need and have the right to sex education and sexual health services that are evidence-informed, comprehensive in scope, confidential, equitable, accessible, medically accurate and complete, age and developmentally appropriate, culturally responsive, and trauma-informed and resilience-oriented.
                
                
                    (2)
 Currently, there is a gap between the sex education that young people should be receiving based on expert standards and the sex education many actually receive.
                
                
                    (3)
 Only 36 States and the District of Columbia mandate sex education or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) education in schools.
                
                
                    (4)
 When there is sex education or instruction regarding HIV or sexually transmitted infections (STI), 13 States do not require the content to be evidence-informed, medically accurate and complete, age and developmentally appropriate, or culturally responsive.
                
                
                    (5)
 Many sex education programs and sexual health services currently available were not designed to and do not currently meet the needs of underserved young people. Some such programs and services actually harm underserved young people.
                
                
                    (6)
 For underserved young people, a lack of comprehensive in scope, confidential, equitable, and accessible sex education and sexual health services is not unfamiliar, but rather a longstanding manifestation of white supremacy, which has touched every aspect of our history, culture, and institutions, including the education and health care systems.
                
                
                    (7)
 The development and delivery of sexual health education and sexual health services in the United States historically has been rooted in the oppression of Black, Indigenous, Latine, Asian American, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, and other People of Color.
                
                
                    (8)
 The United States has a long history of eugenics and forced sterilization. The sexual and reproductive rights and bodily autonomy of specific communities deemed undesirable or defective were targeted by our governments resulting in state-sanctioned violence and generations of trauma and oppression. These communities include—
                    
                        (A)
 people with low incomes;   (B) immigrants;
                    
                    
                        (C)
 people with disabilities;   (D) people living with HIV;
                    
                    
                        (E)
 survivors of interpersonal violence;   (F) people who are incarcerated, detained, or who otherwise have encountered the criminal-legal system;
                    
                    
                        (G)
 Black, Indigenous, Latine, Asian American, and other People of Color;
                    
                    
                        (H)
 people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer; and
                    
                    
                        (I)
 young people who are pregnant and parenting.    (9) Black young people are more likely to receive abstinence-only instruction. Research shows that abstinence-only instruction, also known as sexual risk avoidance instruction, is ineffective in comparison to comprehensive sex education.
                
                
                    (10)
 Black, Indigenous, and Latine young people are disproportionately more likely to be diagnosed with an STI, have an unintended pregnancy, or experience sexual assault.
                
                
                    (11)
 The framework of Reproductive Justice acknowledges and aims to address the legacy of white supremacy, systemic oppression, and the restrictions on sex education and sexual health services that disproportionately impact underserved communities. Reproductive Justice will be achieved when all people regardless of actual or perceived race, color, ethnicity, national origin, religion, immigration status, sex (including gender identity and sexual orientation), disability status, pregnancy or parenting status, or age have the power to make decisions about their bodies, health, sexuality, families, and communities in all areas of life.
                
                
                    (12)
 Increased resources are required for sex education and sexual health services to reach all young people, redress inequities and their impacts on underserved young people, and achieve Reproductive Justice for young people.
                
                
                    (13)
 Such sex education and sexual health services should—  (A) promote and uphold the rights of young people to information and services in order to make and exercise informed and responsible decisions about their sexual health;
                    
                    
                        (B)
 be evidence-informed, comprehensive in scope, confidential, equitable, accessible, age and developmentally appropriate, culturally responsive, and trauma-informed and resilience-oriented;
                    
                    
                        (C)
 include instruction and materials that address—  (i) puberty and adolescent development;
                        
                        
                            (ii)
 sexual and reproductive anatomy and physiology;   (iii) sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression;
                        
                        
                            (iv)
 contraception, pregnancy, and reproduction;   (v) HIV and other STIs;
                        
                        
                            (vi)
 consent and healthy relationships; and   (vii) interpersonal violence;
                        
                    
                    
                        (D)
 promote gender equity and be inclusive of young people with varying gender identities, gender expressions, and sexual orientations;
                    
                    
                        (E)
 promote safe and healthy relationships; and   (F) promote racial equity and be responsive to the needs of young people who are Black, Indigenous, and other People of Color.
