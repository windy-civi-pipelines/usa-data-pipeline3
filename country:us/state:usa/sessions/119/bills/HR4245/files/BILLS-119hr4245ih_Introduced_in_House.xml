These reports continue to show a clear pattern of human rights violations, including murder, rape, torture, death threats, extortion, and imprisonment, in every region of the world based on sexual orientation and gender identity.

USAID has also referred to sex workers as a <quote>most-at-risk population</quote>. The anti-prostitution loyalty oath that health care providers receiving United States assistance must take isolates sex-worker-led and serving groups from programs and reinforces stigma, undermining both the global AIDS response and human rights. The Supreme Court found this requirement unconstitutional as it applies to United States nongovernmental organizations and their foreign affiliates in 2013.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HCD3CD72F80E349AC95C878E49F857F98"><enum>(13)</enum><text>According to the Trans Murder Monitoring Project, which monitors homicides of transgender individuals, there were at least 350 cases of reported killings of trans and gender-diverse people between October 1, 2023, and September 30, 2024.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HB5E03D9DC3544C34B41DF6DEF9284F01"><enum>(14)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">In many countries, intersex individuals experience prejudice and discrimination because their bodies do not conform to general expectations about sex and gender. Because of these expectations, medically unnecessary interventions are often performed in infancy without the consent or approval of intersex individuals, in violation of international human rights standards, and are then often denied official identification papers, blocking them from accessing basic services and legal protections.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H1AA1EECF2C62443BABBB11712F17E63E"><enum>(15)</enum><text>Asylum and refugee protection are critical last-resort protections for LGBTQI individuals, but those who seek such protections face ostracization and abuse in refugee camps and detention facilities. They are frequently targeted for violence, including sexual assault, in refugee camps and in immigration detention. LGBTQI individuals may be segregated against their will for long periods in solitary confinement, in an effort to protect them from such violence, but prolonged solitary confinement itself represents an additional form of abuse that is profoundly damaging to the social and psychological well-being of any individual.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HD831B7AB197A4F949EBC3222A920CBE6"><enum>(16)</enum><text>The global COVID–19 pandemic exacerbated inequalities that LGBTQI individuals face, including access to health care, stigma, and discrimination, undermining LGBTQI rights around the world.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HEFD07DF7B2E044CFB3F8308EA8AA37EE"><enum>(17)</enum><text>In December 2011, President Barack Obama directed all Federal foreign affairs agencies to ensure that their diplomatic, humanitarian, health and foreign assistance programs take into account the needs of marginalized LGBTQI communities and persons.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H6CBF12B562234FEB88F458DA3BF14526"><enum>(18)</enum><text>In 2015, the Department of State established the position of Special Envoy for the Human Rights of LGBTQI Persons.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H98030DCF2A1846D39594E4B763DBA598"><enum>(19)</enum><text>In 2021, President Joseph Biden issued the Memorandum on Advancing the Human Rights of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Intersex Persons Around the World, which stated that it is the policy of the United States to pursue an end to violence and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or sex characteristics and called for United States global leadership on LGBTQI rights.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H6F90446E12CC436FA42CAB2055A20B37"><enum>(20)</enum><text>In Bostock v. Clayton County, the Supreme Court held that title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation.
