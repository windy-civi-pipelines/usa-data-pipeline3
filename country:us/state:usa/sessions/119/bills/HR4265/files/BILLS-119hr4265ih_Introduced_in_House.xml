Jackson Women’s Health Organization (142 S. Ct. 2228 (2022)) (referred to in this section as the <quote>Dobbs decision</quote>), the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade (410 U.S. 113 (1973)), eliminating the constitutional right to abortion and reversing decades of precedent recognizing the constitutional right to an abortion.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H544C8F36B0DD4D6E89FA191F2FA47B7B"><enum>(2)</enum><text>While abortion has never been accessible to all even under the framework of Roe v. Wade, the Dobbs decision has decimated access for millions of people in the United States.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H830A8F4367D244FC8760C27044389184"><enum>(3)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">As expected, the impacts of the Dobbs decision have fallen the hardest on people who already face barriers to health care access due to systemic barriers and discrimination, particularly Black people, Indigenous people, and other people of color, people with disabilities, people in rural areas, young people, people with documentation barriers, LGBTQ+ people, people who are parenting, people with complex medical needs who require hospital-based care, and people having difficulty making ends meet.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H0397FEB6752041489ED99F11737A1645"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Abortion bans prevent many people from accessing the care they want and need.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H1870761E2E134695976D6196BBB7E328"><enum>(5)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">People have always had abortions and always will, even in the face of legal, financial, and logistical barriers, or criminalization. However, since the Dobbs decision, many are being forced to travel hundreds of miles away from their homes and communities, taking extra time off of work, forgoing days of pay, piecing together extended childcare, and finding ways to cover significant travel expenses. Others are being forced to carry their pregnancies to term.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HD1BE04C01F68413EA800A0AE6AE957DA"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Just months after the Dobbs decision, one-third of women of reproductive age in the United States faced excessive travel times for abortion. For residents of States that had banned abortion, travel times increased by more than 4 hours on average. Black women faced the greatest impact, with 40 percent needing to drive at least 1 hour for abortion care after the decision, versus 15 percent before the decision.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H44281DC6133245AFA2436AD14100E8D1"><enum>(7)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Abortion funds and practical support funds (referred to in this section as <quote>abortion funds</quote> or <quote>funds</quote>) are community-based organizations that support people in overcoming financial and logistical barriers to abortion care. In 2024, abortion funds provided over $50,000,000 for abortion funding and over $13,000,000 for logistical support.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HD71D4E649FD24111A8D4CCD2B4554554"><enum>(8)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Funds work together to remove financial and logistical barriers to abortion access and have been doing this work for decades. Funds help cover transportation, food, lodging, childcare, translation support, doula services, and other supports abortion seekers and their families need.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HFFBC1E06F39A4A659DB90512DE701F1D"><enum>(9)</enum><text>Many funds are led by people who have had abortions themselves, including a growing base of Black and Brown leaders who have themselves faced abortion obstacles and understand the complex circumstances individuals may face.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H2D31565C747D4687888B4403889ABA02"><enum>(10)</enum><text>Abortion funds have a history of being under-resourced and rely mostly on volunteer time and energy to support communities.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H69B92591FADF4CE79F2DB7B2FC399575"><enum>(11)</enum><text>Abortion and practical support funds hold some of the closest ties to people who are having abortions and have the first hand experience, up-to-date and on-the-ground knowledge, and the regional and national connections needed to support abortion seekers financially, emotionally, or logistically.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H3FEC2B703A8649BB858B578C85B778F8"><enum>(12)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">More and more States are seeking to ban abortion or enact extreme restrictions, significantly limiting the circumstances in which abortions are available. Furthermore, people have been prevented from seeking care because of the confusion created by new and changing abortion restrictions, misinformation, disinformation, and muddled judicial decisions, all of which have contributed to a chilling effect for people seeking legal care out of State. People seeking abortions often do not have a full understanding shifting legal landscape, including abortion laws, in their State. People calling abortion funds for support often ask if they are doing something illegal by traveling to get care of the abortion laws in their State and people calling abortion funds for support often ask if they are doing something illegal by traveling to get care. Abortion funds serve to mitigate this confusion and directly connect people to accurate information.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H67CF3B69AA4D4C318D696034B67264C5"><enum>(13)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Following the Dobbs decision, the demand for abortions has surged, with requests increasing by 56 percent from 2023 to 2024. During the same period, the number of abortion seekers supported by abortion funds grew by 33 percent. Despite immense efforts from abortion funds from 2022 to 2024, the number of callers who received support decreased from 70 percent to 54 percent. This is due to escalating costs of abortion care and practical support, as well as inadequate funding to meet the post-Dobbs demand.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H6140BC8FBABC494C95BFEDF857D6D9C3"><enum>(14)</enum><text>Clinics in States where abortion is legal and more accessible continue to receive an influx of people seeking abortions.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H0468D02D52DB470C8EF2BDB9F1C7578F"><enum>(15)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">When people are not able to access an abortion when they need it, they may be forced to seek an abortion later into their pregnancy. This increases costs exponentially. Barriers to abortion care after the Dobbs decision have led to an increasing complexity in the cases that abortion funds are managing. People who are forced to cross State lines for abortion care may need increased financial support for coordinating and paying for higher logistical barriers (such as transportation, lodging, meals, childcare, medication) to access the abortion care they want, need, and deserve. For many, the increased financial burden will push abortion care completely out of reach without financial and logistical assistance for appointment costs and travel.</text></paragraph></section><section id="H66435FC5C15945F7B3062B055F83E71C"><enum>3.</enum><header>Grants to pay for travel expenses and logistical support for individuals accessing abortion services</header><subsection id="HA5F5450271634606AECEEE2C1266938B"><enum>(a)</enum><header>In general</header><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The Secretary of the Treasury (referred to in this section as the <quote>Secretary</quote>) may award grants to eligible entities to pay for travel-related expenses and logistical support for individuals with respect to accessing abortion services.</text></subsection><subsection id="HA806A1CD6D53435F996B40518A743484"><enum>(b)</enum><header>Timing</header><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Beginning not later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall solicit applications for grants under this section.</text></subsection><subsection id="H2A1022BE53B2451A8F56BA0C2DD33652"><enum>(c)</enum><header>Use of funds</header><paragraph id="H2A61AFE21FC6413187482CA9E936D621"><enum>(1)</enum><header>Permissible uses</header><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">An eligible entity receiving a grant under this section shall use the grant for travel-related expenses and logistical support for individuals with respect to accessing abortion services, which may include any of the following expenses and support:</text><subparagraph id="HA4B108DFAAD6458CBF0B3E394A6E28E8"><enum>(A)</enum><text>Round trip travel to the location where the abortion services are provided.</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="HC7B4274746D54AB0BE24ADFB8B67671E"><enum>(B)</enum><text>Lodging.</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="HD19891177EC3417CBD6F06BEDDE5DEE6"><enum>(C)</enum><text>Meals.</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="H86A7A7F4BD484AAE9B2F110E19E224D7"><enum>(D)</enum><text>Childcare.</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="H2B87959E9A25497DB509491A2EA12E8E"><enum>(E)</enum><text>Translation services.</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="H6EB3800BA3FF4D88AB385A20331615EC"><enum>(F)</enum><text>Doula care.</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="HD3B389C443104DCF88DB7D88E3430A72"><enum>(G)</enum><text>Patient education and information services.</text></subparagraph><subparagraph commented="no" display-inline="no-display-inline" id="HC5593961358C434FA880FCA859BE7E77"><enum>(H)</enum><text>Lost wages.</text></subparagraph></paragraph><paragraph id="H7A186503A1FC47CABC7E1743F37F54C5"><enum>(2)</enum><header>Organizational costs</header><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">An eligible entity receiving a grant under this section may use up to, but not more than, 15 percent of the grant funds to cover organizational costs such as—</text><subparagraph id="HC7735CAC273E462FAF259003F8EFC5A2"><enum>(A)</enum><text>community outreach efforts;</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="H2E2B5F0409DC44F7B4751DD54F37E15B"><enum>(B)</enum><text>physical infrastructure construction and maintenance;</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="HB374815178534A148E63690F6001D220"><enum>(C)</enum><text>website development and maintenance;
