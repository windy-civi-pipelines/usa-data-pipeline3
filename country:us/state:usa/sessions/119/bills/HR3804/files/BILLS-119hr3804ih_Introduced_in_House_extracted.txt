Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Space Launch Noise Mitigation Study Act.

Section 2:
2.Sense of CongressIt is the sense of Congress that— 
(1)the commercial space launch industry is a fundamental part of United States national security and contributes greatly to assured access to space; (2)United States national security benefits from a competitive and diverse launch industry; 
(3)space services are critical to sectors including transportation, communication, agriculture, financial services, and others; and (4)as referenced in the report of the Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives accompanying H.R. 8070 of the 118th Congress, the increase of launches as a result of national security and commercial launches can be disruptive to nearby communities.

Section 3:
3.Study on space launch noise mitigation 
(a)StudyNot later than one year after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment shall complete a study on the feasibility of conducting a space launch noise mitigation grant program. (b)Matters includedThe study under subsection (a) shall include the following: 
(1)An estimate of funds necessary to carry out a space launch noise mitigation grant program, including estimated breakdowns for different covered facilities, and how many covered facilities are in each eligible community.  (2)Recommendations on the geographic range for which communities shall be eligible. 
(3)Recommendations on noise mitigating techniques and technologies for eligible communities, and the estimated cost for each recommendation. (4)Recommendations for ways the Space Force can work better with eligible communities to avoid noise disturbances. 
(5)Recommendations for a community outreach program to educate eligible communities near launch ranges on the benefits of space. (c)ConsiderationsIn conducting the study under subsection (a), the Under Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Commanders of Space Launch Delta 30 and Space Launch Delta 45, shall consider the following: 
(1)C-weighted single-event noise, including noise generated by sonic booms, of 100 dB or greater. (2)A-weighted maximum sound level of 90 dB or greater. 
(3)C-weighted day night average sound level of 115 dB Peak or greater. (4)PK 15. 
(5)A direct association between noise and its measured effect on the geographic regions where sonic booms from space activity can be heard. (6)A literature review of the research to date. 
(7)Structure responses to vibration from sound power levels and overpressure. (8)Data from all Federal ranges with at least one or more vertical space launches per year in 2024 and thereafter. 
(9)Sonic boom monitoring stations for a wide area in the region surrounding the space launch range. (10)Any other metrics or indicators the Under Secretary determines appropriate. 
(d)DefinitionsIn this section: (1)The term covered facility means a hospital, daycare facility, school, facility serving senior citizens, or a single- or multi-unit private residence, that is— 
(A)built before January 1, 2026; and (B)not owned by the Federal Government. 
(2)The term eligible community means a unit of local government serving a geographic region that the Secretary of the Air Force determines to be negatively affected by noise from space launch activities of the Department of Defense. (3)The term PK 15 means the calculated peak noise level, without frequency weighting, expected to be exceeded by 15 percent of all space launch activities of the Department of Defense. 
(4)The term space launch noise mitigation grant program means a potential grant program administered by the Secretary of Defense under which eligible communities install technologies to mitigate noise from the space launch activities of the Department of Defense.
