IV119th CONGRESS1st SessionH. RES. 484IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESJune 6, 2025Mrs. Dingell submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and CommerceRESOLUTIONExpressing support for the recognition of Hidradenitis Suppurativa Awareness Week. 
Whereas Hidradenitis Suppurativa (in this resolution referred to as HS) is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease that affects approximately 3,300,000 people in the United States; Whereas HS causes painful, boil-like nodules and abscesses anywhere on the body, and can progress to form tunnels under the skin and cause extensive scarring; 
Whereas individuals with HS frequently suffer from 5 primary domains of physical and emotional suffering, pain, drainage, odor, itching, and profound psychological distress; Whereas HS is associated with one of the highest completed suicide rates among dermatological diseases, second only to melanoma; 
Whereas 75 percent of individuals with HS are misdiagnosed or not diagnosed until after age 25, missing critical windows for early intervention and care; Whereas delayed diagnosis contributes to worsening disease progression, higher healthcare costs, avoidable emergency room visits, and unnecessary procedures; 
Whereas individuals are often diagnosed with HS in the prime of their lives, affecting their ability to work, maintain relationships, and participate fully in society; Whereas, as of June 1, 2025, there are only 3 biologic therapies approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of HS; 
Whereas additional research is urgently needed to develop new treatments, understand the pathogenesis of the disease, identify biomarkers of HS, and improve outcomes for HS patients; Whereas Federal policy can play a critical role in improving access to biologic therapies, wound care, and comprehensive care for HS patients; and 
Whereas designating the first week of June as Hidradenitis Suppurativa Awareness Week would increase public awareness, foster understanding, and catalyze progress in diagnosing, treating, and ultimately curing HS: Now, therefore, be it That the House of Representatives— 

                (1)
 supports the recognition of Hidradenitis Suppurativa Awareness Week; and
             
(2)recognizes the importance of— (A)increasing awareness and education about HS among the public and health professionals; 
(B)promoting timely and accurate diagnosis of HS through improved screening and culturally competent care; (C)supporting biomedical research to better understand HS pathogenesis, treatment efficacy, and long-term outcomes; 
(D)accelerating the development of effective treatments and expanding access to existing therapies for HS; and (E)advancing policies that address disparities in access to care for patients with HS and improve the quality of life for individuals living with HS and the caregivers of such individuals.
