<whereas><text>Whereas Hidradenitis Suppurativa (in this resolution referred to as <quote>HS</quote>) is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease that affects approximately 3,300,000 people in the United States;</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas HS causes painful, boil-like nodules and abscesses anywhere on the body, and can progress to form tunnels under the skin and cause extensive scarring;</text></whereas> 
<whereas><text>Whereas individuals with HS frequently suffer from 5 primary domains of physical and emotional suffering, pain, drainage, odor, itching, and profound psychological distress;</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas HS is associated with one of the highest completed suicide rates among dermatological diseases, second only to melanoma;</text></whereas> 
<whereas><text>Whereas 75 percent of individuals with HS are misdiagnosed or not diagnosed until after age 25, missing critical windows for early intervention and care;</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas delayed diagnosis contributes to worsening disease progression, higher healthcare costs, avoidable emergency room visits, and unnecessary procedures;</text></whereas> 
<whereas><text>Whereas individuals are often diagnosed with HS in the prime of their lives, affecting their ability to work, maintain relationships, and participate fully in society;</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas, as of June 1, 2025, there are only 3 biologic therapies approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of HS;</text></whereas> 
<whereas><text>Whereas additional research is urgently needed to develop new treatments, understand the pathogenesis of the disease, identify biomarkers of HS, and improve outcomes for HS patients;</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas Federal policy can play a critical role in improving access to biologic therapies, wound care, and comprehensive care for HS patients; and</text></whereas> 
<whereas><text>Whereas designating the first week of June as <quote>Hidradenitis Suppurativa Awareness Week</quote> would increase public awareness, foster understanding, and catalyze progress in diagnosing, treating, and ultimately curing HS: Now, therefore, be it</text></whereas></preamble><resolution-body style="traditional" id="HAF9F514D022441B6A6AD729C56CBAD4A"> <section display-inline="yes-display-inline" section-type="undesignated-section" id="HCB12AF1807754E5793D61FE84C8EEC32"><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">That the House of Representatives—</text>
