Whereas the NSF has supported cutting-edge science and engineering projects in all 50 States and 14 United States territories, and has fostered scientific collaboration on all 7 continents; Whereas the NSF has helped keep the United States at the forefront of scientific discovery and drawn some of the world’s finest scientists and researchers to conduct research and work in the United States through its merit-based and peer-reviewed grant selection process; 
Whereas the NSF supports invaluable research facilities and infrastructure, including ground-based observational facilities, oceanographic research vessels, and supercomputers for use by the scientific community;  Whereas, through investments, the NSF helped catalyze the internet, advance technology for MRI machines, 3–D printing, and artificial intelligence, create American Sign Language, detect gravitational waves, develop LASIK eye surgery, and much more; and 
Whereas, on average, NSF supports roughly 350,000 researchers, students, teachers, and entrepreneurs on an annual basis, and, over its lifetime, 268 have been Nobel Prize winners: Now, therefore, be it That the House of Representatives—
