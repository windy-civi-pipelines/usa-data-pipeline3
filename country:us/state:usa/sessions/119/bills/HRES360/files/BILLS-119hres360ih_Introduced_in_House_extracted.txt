IV119th CONGRESS1st SessionH. RES. 360IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESApril 29, 2025Ms. Plaskett (for herself, Ms. DelBene, Ms. Brownley, Mr. Davis of North Carolina, Mrs. Cherfilus-McCormick, Ms. Sewell, Ms. Stansbury, Ms. Adams, Ms. Clarke of New York, Mr. Davis of Illinois, Ms. Wilson of Florida, and Mr. Johnson of Georgia) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and CommerceRESOLUTIONExpressing support for the designation of the last Tuesday of April each year as APOL1–Mediated Kidney Disease (AMKD) Awareness Day.Whereas kidney disease affects an estimated 35,500,000 Americans, and more than 550,000 are on dialysis;Whereas Black individuals with kidney disease are more likely to develop kidney failure than any other racial group;Whereas the health disparities in kidney failure are unsustainable, with Black people making up 13 percent of the United States population but accounting for 30 percent of those with kidney failure;Whereas kidney failure places enormous physical, emotional, and financial burdens on individuals and costs the Medicare Program over $45,000,000,000 annually;Whereas there are genetic factors that can increase an individual’s risk for kidney disease;Whereas one such genetic factor is having variants (mutations) in the apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) gene;Whereas people are more likely to have APOL1 gene variants if they are from Western or Central Africa or have an ancestor who came from these regions;Whereas these variants can increase susceptibility for APOL1-mediated kidney disease (AMKD), a rapidly progressive form of kidney disease that can lead to kidney failure;Whereas, it is estimated that if a patient has variants in both copies of the APOL1 gene, there is a 1 in 5 chance they will go on to develop kidney disease, and an estimated 13 percent of Black Americans have variants in both copies of the APOL1 gene;Whereas a person with AMKD may not have any symptoms of kidney disease until their kidneys are close to failing;Whereas genetic testing can reveal an individual’s risk for AMKD, empowering them to take the steps necessary to protect their kidney health before it is too late;Whereas individuals who are found to have APOL1 genetic variants can reduce their risk for kidney failure by meeting with their doctor regularly, eating a healthy diet, taking all medications as prescribed, exercising for at least 30 minutes a day, and not smoking or using tobacco;Whereas additional awareness and research of APOL1 genetic mutations are needed to improve understanding of the kidney disease disparities in this population;Whereas there are currently no Food and Drug Administration-approved treatments available for APOL1-mediated kidney disease, but ongoing research and clinical trials could provide an opportunity for researchers to develop and test safe treatments for APOL1-mediated kidney disease; andWhereas the House of Representatives can raise public awareness of APOL1-mediated kidney disease: Now, therefore, be itThat the House of Representatives—(1)expresses support for the designation of APOL1-Mediated Kidney Disease (AMKD) Awareness Day;(2)encourages each person of the United States to become better informed about and aware of kidney disease and APOL1-mediated kidney disease; and(3)encourages people from or with ancestry from Western and Central Africa to consider genetic testing for APOL1 gene mutations.
