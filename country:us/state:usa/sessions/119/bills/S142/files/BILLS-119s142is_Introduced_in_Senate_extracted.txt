Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Wildland Firefighters Congressional Gold Medal Act.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following:(1)Wildland fires have increased in intensity and severity over the 30-year period preceding the date of enactment of this Act, causing catastrophic destruction to homes, infrastructure, and valuable Federal, State, and private lands. More than 1,000,000,000 acres of land across the United States are at risk of wildfire, including approximately 117,000,000 acres of Federal land that have been identified as high or very high risk for wildfire potential.(2)The Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the National Park Service, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs collectively employ more than 18,700 wildland firefighters to combat wildfires across millions of acres of public and private lands each year, while thousands more workers and volunteers serve as State, local, and contract wildland firefighters.(3)As the wildland-urban interface expands, wildfires increasingly find their way out of the backcountry and into the backyards of communities across the United States. Wildland firefighters are evolving their skillsets, tactics, and strategies to address the growing threat of wildfire in the 21st century.(4)While the protection of life and property remains a top priority, wildland firefighters also have an important role in responsible forest management and conservation. Wildland firefighters perform prescribed burns and other forest management activities, including timber harvests, contribute to healthy forests, and reduce catastrophic wildfire risk.(5)Each wildland firefighter is specialized and trained to work in dynamic and extraordinarily dangerous environments. Wildland firefighters routinely work long days while on a 2-week rotation, often sleeping in inhospitable conditions.(6)According to the Forest Service, firefighters generally work 16-hour days while fighting a fire, and they typically exceed 2,500 operational hours in a 6-month period.(7)Wildland firefighter crews are all-hazards frontline emergency responders that use any means necessary to protect life and property while responding to floods, hurricanes, pandemics, and acts of terrorism.(8)Engine and hand crews, the primary firefighting workforce, come in varying sizes and modules that can be tailored to fit the specific needs and terrain obstacles that each fire presents.(9)Interagency hotshot crews are highly skilled mobile hand crews with elite knowledge about fire suppression tactics.(10)Pilots and aerial fire suppression crews take to the skies with air tankers and helicopters to drop water and fire retardant, supporting decision-makers on the ground.(11)Aerially delivered firefighters, including helitack crews and smokejumpers, exit helicopters and jump from planes into remote and difficult-to-reach areas, providing quick and targeted fire suppression and emergency medical short-haul extraction. These fire personnel provide oversight and direct action on initial and extended attack incidents. (12)Wildland firefighters in the United States also answer the call to fight wildfires internationally. During the record-setting fires in Australia in 2020, the United States sent 362 firefighters to help. During Canadaâ€™s historic 2023 fire season, more than 2,000 Federal wildland firefighters answered the call.(13)As of the date of enactment of this Act, the United States maintains mutual assistance and cooperation agreements for wildland firefighting efforts with Canada, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, and Portugal.(14)The increases in the severity of wildfires and in annual fire season active months have also increased the demand for wildland firefighters and associated employees. Recruitment and retention of wildland firefighters has been a national issue for many years.(15)Wildland firefighters put their lives on the line to keep the people of the United States safe, and some pay the ultimate sacrifice to do so. Between January 1, 2019, and January 1, 2025, 98 wildland firefighters have lost their lives fighting fires. Acute and secondary effects from wildfire, such as wildfire smoke exposure, are directly linked to tens of thousands of firefighter and civilian deaths each year.(16)June 30 to July 6 of each year is recognized as a Week of Remembrance to honor the fallen wildland firefighters who sacrificed their lives to protect the wildlands of the United States.(17)National Wildland Firefighter Day is held annually on July 2 to recognize all who are devoted to wildland firefighting.(18)The exemplary efforts of wildland firefighters are deserving of recognition, and it is appropriate and proper to honor those who have previously served, as well as current and future firefighters. Wildland firefighters showcase principles of duty, respect, and integrity in every aspect of service. Each firefighter exhibits strength, resiliency, and grit to protect the forests, grasslands, and communities of the United States. Wildland firefighters do not shy away from dangerous situations, but instead risk life and limb to help others. The outstanding accomplishments of these brave individuals continue an unparalleled legacy of public service.
