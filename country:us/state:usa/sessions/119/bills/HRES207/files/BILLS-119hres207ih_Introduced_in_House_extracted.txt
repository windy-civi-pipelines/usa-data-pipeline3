Whereas there are approximately 32,244,214 Latinas living in the United States, and 1,165,312 Latinas live in the State of Illinois; Whereas Latinas continue to be greatly underrepresented in elected office; 
Whereas Latinas represent 9.6 percent of the United States population but only 2.6 percent of elected officeholders in State and 3.6 percent in Federal offices across the country; Whereas the State of Illinois is a model for supporting and electing Latinas; 
Whereas the State of Illinois has significantly increased the representation of Latinas at all levels of government, including electing the diverse and powerful Latinas of Illinois’ Third Congressional District, such as— (1)Village of Franklin Park Clerk, April Arellano;  
(2)Village of Addison Trustee, Maria Reyes;  (3)Bensenville Village Trustee, Rosa Carmona;  
(4)Hanover Township Trustee, Denise Noyola;  (5)Council Member for the City of Elgin, Rosamaria Martinez;

(12)State Representative Norma Hernandez;  (13)State Senator Karina Villa;  
(14)State Senator Graciela Guzman; and  (15)State Senator Cristina Castro; 
Whereas many of the Latinas elected to their positions are the first Latinas in their roles or the first Latinas to serve in their communities; Whereas the work of Latinas at all levels of government in the State of Illinois has resulted in the codification of women’s rights and the expansion of health care for undocumented people; 
Whereas the grassroots, organizing, and political participation of Latinas resulted in the election of the first Latina from the Midwest to Congress; Whereas the voices, lived experiences, and contributions of Latinas in the State of Illinois continue to have long-lasting, positive impacts for the communities that they serve; 
Whereas Latinas representing Latinas is necessary to build a multicultural, multigenerational movement that acknowledges the shared humanity of others; Whereas significant progress has been made to increase the representation of Latinas in all decision-making spaces; and 
Whereas there is still work that needs to be done until Latinas achieve equitable representation in all sectors, industries, and leadership roles: Now, therefore, be it That the House of Representatives— 
(1)celebrates the impact and contributions of contemporary Latinas in the State of Illinois; (2)acknowledges the value of Latinas and the essential role they play in this Nation’s multicultural, multigenerational democracy; and 
(3)recognizes the importance of accurate and timely data on Latinas living in the United States and the role that the United States Census Bureau plays in delivering data that impacts the political and economic power and influence of Latinas.
