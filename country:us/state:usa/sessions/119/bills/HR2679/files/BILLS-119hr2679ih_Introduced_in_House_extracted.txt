Section 2:
2.Cool roof product rebate program (a)EstablishmentThe Secretary shall establish and carry out a program to provide rebates to eligible households for the purchase and installation of eligible cool roof products.  
(b)Rebate amountThe amount of a rebate provided under the program established under subsection (a) shall be— (1)with respect to an eligible cool roof product installed on a low-sloped roof— 
(A)$0.25 per square foot if such eligible cool roof product has— (i)a minimum 3-year aged solar reflectance of 0.80 and a minimum 3-year aged thermal emittance of 0.75; or 
(ii)a minimum 3-year aged Solar Reflectance Index of 99; and  (B)$0.75 per square foot if such eligible cool roof product has— 
(i)a minimum 3-year aged solar reflectance of 0.90 and a minimum 3-year aged thermal emittance of 0.75; or (ii)a minimum 3-year aged Solar Reflectance Index of 114; and 
(2)with respect to an eligible cool roof product installed on a steep-sloped roof— (A)$0.25 per square foot— 
(i)if such eligible cool roof product is an asphalt shingle product and has— (I)a minimum 3-year aged solar reflectance of 0.25 and a minimum 3-year aged thermal emittance of 0.75; or 
(II)a minimum 3-year aged Solar Reflectance Index of 23; and (ii)if such eligible cool roof product is not an asphalt shingle product and has—

(5)Eligible household 
(A)In generalExcept as provided in subparagraph (B), the term eligible household means an individual or family— (i)residing in a single-family or multi-family building;  
(ii)the total annual income of which is less than 200 percent of the median income of the ZIP Code in which the individual or family resides (as reported by the Department of Housing and Urban Development); and (iii)residing in a ZIP Code Tabulation Area that is in the 75th percentile or higher of the Heat and Health Index of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
(B)District of Columbia, Alaska, Hawaii, and territoriesWith respect to an individual or family residing in the District of Columbia, Alaska, Hawaii, or a territory of the United States, until the date that their respective State or territory is added to the Heat and Health Index of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the term eligible household means that such individual or family— (i)resides in a single-family or multi-family building; and 
(ii)has a total annual income that is less than 200 percent of the median income of the ZIP Code in which the individual or family resides (as reported by the Department of Housing and Urban Development). (6)Incident solar fluxThe term incident solar flux means the solar power per unit area that strikes a surface.  
(7)Low-sloped roofThe term low-sloped roof means a roof with a slope (ratio of rise to run) of 2:12 or less. (8)Radiant heat fluxThe term radiant heat flux means the radiant power per unit area.  
(9)Reflected solar fluxThe term reflected solar flux means the solar power per unit area reflected from a surface. (10)SecretaryThe term Secretary means the Secretary of Energy. 
(11)Solar reflectanceThe term solar reflectance means the ratio of reflected solar flux to the incident solar flux. (12)Solar Reflectance IndexThe term Solar Reflectance Index means a calculated value that combines solar reflectance with thermal emittance into a single metric, in accordance with section 2.2.9 of the manual titled CRRC–1 Roof Product Rating Program Manual of the Cool Roof Rating Council. 
(13)Steep-sloped roofThe term steep-sloped roof means a roof with a slope (ratio of rise to run) greater than 2:12. (14)Thermal emittanceThe term thermal emittance means the ratio of the radiant heat flux emitted by a material tested at a temperature near 300 Kelvin to that emitted by a blackbody radiator at the same temperature.
