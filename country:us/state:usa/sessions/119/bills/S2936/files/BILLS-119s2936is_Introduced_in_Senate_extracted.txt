Section 1:
1. Short title This Act may be cited as the Stop ANTIFA Act of 2025.

Section 2:
2. Findings Congress finds the following: 
 (1) Antifa is a militarist, anarchist enterprise that explicitly calls for the overthrow of the United States Government, law enforcement authorities, and the system of law in the United States.   (2) It uses illegal means to organize and execute a campaign of violence and terrorism nationwide to accomplish these goals.  
 (3) This campaign involves coordinated efforts to obstruct enforcement of Federal laws through armed standoffs with law enforcement, organized riots, violent assaults on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other law enforcement officers, and routine doxing of and other threats against political figures and activists.   (4) Antifa recruits, trains, and radicalizes young people in the United States to engage in this violence and suppression of political activity, then employs elaborate means and mechanisms to shield the identities of its operatives, conceal its funding sources and operations in an effort to frustrate law enforcement, and recruit additional members.  
 (5) Individuals associated with and acting on behalf of Antifa further coordinate with other organizations and entities for the purpose of spreading, fomenting, and advancing political violence and suppressing lawful political speech.   (6) This organized effort designed to achieve policy objectives by coercion and intimidation is domestic terrorism.  
 (7) Heinous assassinations and other acts of political violence in the United States have dramatically increased in recent years. Even in the aftermath of the horrifying assassination of Charlie Kirk, some individuals who adhered to the alleged shooter’s ideology embraced and cheered this evil murder while actively encouraging more political violence. This was preceded by the 2024 assassination of a senior healthcare executive and the 2022 assassination attempt against Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Two separate assassination attempts against the life of President Donald Trump took place during the 2024 Presidential election cycle in less than 3 months.   (8) Riots in Los Angeles and Portland reflect a more than 1,000 percent increase in attacks on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers since January 21, 2025, compared to the same period last year. On September 24, 2025, a shooting targeting a facility of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Dallas resulted in multiple casualties. Separate anti-police and criminal justice riots have left many people dead and injured and inflicted over $2,000,000,000 in property damage nationwide.  
 (9) This political violence is not a series of isolated incidents and does not emerge organically. Instead, it is a culmination of sophisticated, organized campaigns of targeted intimidation, radicalization, threats, and violence designed to silence opposing speech, limit political activity, change or direct policy outcomes, and prevent the functioning of a democratic society. A new law enforcement strategy that investigates all participants in these criminal and terroristic conspiracies, including the organized structures, networks, entities, organizations, funding sources, and predicate actions behind them, is required.   (10) These campaigns often begin by isolating and dehumanizing specific targets to justify murder or other violent action against them. They do so through a variety of fora, including anonymous chat forums, in-person meetings, social media, and even educational institutions. These campaigns then escalate to organized doxing, where the private or identifying information of their targets (such as home addresses, phone numbers, or other personal information) is exposed to the public with the explicit intent of encouraging others to harass, intimidate, or violently assault them. As in the case of several agents of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Los Angeles being doxed, the goal of these campaigns can be to obstruct the operations of the Federal Government as well as aid and abet criminal activity the Federal Government is lawfully pursuing. These campaigns are coordinated and perpetrated by actors who have developed a comprehensive strategy to achieve specific policy goals through radicalization and violent intimidation.  
 (11) There are common recurrent motivations and indicia uniting this pattern of violent and terroristic activities under the umbrella of self-described anti-fascism. These movements portray foundational principles of the United States (such as support for law enforcement and border control) as fascist to justify and encourage acts of violent revolution. This anti-fascist lie has become the organizing rallying cry used by domestic terrorists to wage a violent assault against democratic institutions, constitutional rights, and fundamental liberties of the people of the United States.   (12) Common threads animating this violent conduct include— 
 (A) anti-Americanism, anti-capitalism, and anti-Christianity;   (B) support for the overthrow of the United States Government;  
 (C) extremism on migration, race, and gender; and   (D) hostility towards those who hold traditional American views on family, religion, and morality.   
 (13) As described in the Order of September 22, 2025 (90 Fed. Reg. 46317; relating to designating Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization), the groups and entities that perpetuate this extremism have created a movement that embraces and elevates violence to achieve policy outcomes, including justifying additional assassinations. For example, Charlie Kirk’s alleged assassin engraved the bullets used in the murder with so-called anti-fascist rhetoric.   (14) The United States requires a national strategy to investigate and disrupt networks, entities, and organizations that foment political violence so that law enforcement can intervene in criminal conspiracies before they result in violent political acts. Through this comprehensive strategy, law enforcement will disband and uproot networks, entities, and organizations that promote organized violence, violent intimidation, conspiracies against rights, and other efforts to disrupt the functioning of a democratic society.

Section 3:
3. Designation of Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization 
 (a) In general Because of the pattern of political violence by Antifa designed to suppress lawful political activity and obstruct the rule of law, Antifa is designated as a domestic terrorist organization.   (b) Implementation All relevant departments and agencies of the executive branch of the United States Government shall use all applicable authorities to investigate, disrupt, and dismantle any and all illegal operations, especially those involving terrorist actions, conducted by Antifa or a person claiming to act on behalf of Antifa, or for which Antifa or any person claiming to act on behalf of Antifa provided material support, including necessary investigatory and prosecutorial actions against those who fund such operations.

This strategy shall include the investigatory and prosecutorial measures set forth in this section.   (b) Investigations of actions of political violence, terrorism, or to deprive persons of rights The JTTFs shall investigate potential Federal crimes relating to acts of recruiting or radicalizing persons for the purpose of—

(d) Consultation and coordination The JTTFs shall consult and coordinate with executive departments and agencies as needed to determine whether such departments and agencies can apply existing authorities or exercise authorities of the departments and agencies, as appropriate, to support the investigations of the JTTFs and relevant prosecutions of political violence.  
 (e) Operational assistance and coordination The JTTFs may, to the extent permitted by law, request operational assistance from and coordinate with law enforcement partners when investigating domestic terrorism.   (f) Updates The National Joint Terrorism Task Force shall provide regular progress updates to the President through the Assistant to the President and Homeland Security Advisor.

This guidance shall also include an identification of any behaviors, fact patterns, recurrent motivations, or other indicia common to organizations and entities that coordinate these acts in order to direct efforts to identify and prevent potential violent activity.  
 (i) Identifying and disrupting financial networks The Secretary of the Treasury, in coordination with the Attorney General, shall make available all resources, to the maximum extent permitted by law, to identify and disrupt financial networks that fund domestic terrorism and political violence. The Secretary, acting through the Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Office of the Department of the Treasury, shall deploy investigative tools, examine financial flows, and coordinate with partner agencies to trace illicit funding streams. The Secretary shall provide guidance for financial institutions to file Suspicious Activity Reports and investigate indicia of illicit funding streams to ensure such activity is rooted out at the source and referred for law enforcement action, as appropriate.   (j) Stopping financing of political violence and domestic terrorism The Commissioner of Internal Revenue shall take action to ensure that no tax-exempt entities are directly or indirectly financing political violence or domestic terrorism.

 (k) Investigations of individuals engaged in political violence 
 (1) In general All Federal law enforcement agencies with investigative authority shall question and interrogate, within all lawful authorities, individuals engaged in political violence or lawlessness regarding the entity or individual organizing such actions and any related financial sponsorship of those actions prior to adjudication or initiation of a plea agreement.
