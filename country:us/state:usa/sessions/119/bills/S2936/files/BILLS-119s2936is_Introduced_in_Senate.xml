<paragraph id="id07fc1fb0b5374fc49d600b9e8161f2ab"> <enum>(7)</enum> <text>Heinous assassinations and other acts of political violence in the United States have dramatically increased in recent years. Even in the aftermath of the horrifying assassination of Charlie Kirk, some individuals who adhered to the alleged shooter’s ideology embraced and cheered this evil murder while actively encouraging more political violence. This was preceded by the 2024 assassination of a senior healthcare executive and the 2022 assassination attempt against Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Two separate assassination attempts against the life of President Donald Trump took place during the 2024 Presidential election cycle in less than 3 months.</text> </paragraph> <paragraph commented="no" display-inline="no-display-inline" id="idf1f8aa3d67114c27b1ba6d858a9a6263"> <enum>(8)</enum> <text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Riots in Los Angeles and Portland reflect a more than 1,000 percent increase in attacks on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers since January 21, 2025, compared to the same period last year. On September 24, 2025, a shooting targeting a facility of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Dallas resulted in multiple casualties. Separate anti-police and <quote>criminal justice</quote> riots have left many people dead and injured and inflicted over $2,000,000,000 in property damage nationwide.</text> </paragraph> 
<paragraph id="ida2f439a73351427cb56bfdc168c0b658"> <enum>(9)</enum> <text>This political violence is not a series of isolated incidents and does not emerge organically. Instead, it is a culmination of sophisticated, organized campaigns of targeted intimidation, radicalization, threats, and violence designed to silence opposing speech, limit political activity, change or direct policy outcomes, and prevent the functioning of a democratic society. A new law enforcement strategy that investigates all participants in these criminal and terroristic conspiracies, including the organized structures, networks, entities, organizations, funding sources, and predicate actions behind them, is required.</text> </paragraph> <paragraph id="idf09a4559b20e42dcb225c70079850594"> <enum>(10)</enum> <text>These campaigns often begin by isolating and dehumanizing specific targets to justify murder or other violent action against them. They do so through a variety of fora, including anonymous chat forums, in-person meetings, social media, and even educational institutions. These campaigns then escalate to organized doxing, where the private or identifying information of their targets (such as home addresses, phone numbers, or other personal information) is exposed to the public with the explicit intent of encouraging others to harass, intimidate, or violently assault them. As in the case of several agents of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Los Angeles being doxed, the goal of these campaigns can be to obstruct the operations of the Federal Government as well as aid and abet criminal activity the Federal Government is lawfully pursuing. These campaigns are coordinated and perpetrated by actors who have developed a comprehensive strategy to achieve specific policy goals through radicalization and violent intimidation.</text> </paragraph>
