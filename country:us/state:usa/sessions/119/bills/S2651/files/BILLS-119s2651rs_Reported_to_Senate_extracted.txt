Section 6:
203.Housing Supply Frameworks Act(a)FindingsCongress finds the following:(1)The United States is facing a housing supply shortage. This housing supply shortage has resulted in a record number of cost-burdened households across regions and spanning the large and small cities, towns, and coastal and rural communities of the United States.(2)Several factors contribute to the undersupply of housing in the United States, particularly workforce housing, including rising costs of construction, a shortage of labor, supply chain disruptions, and a lack of reliable funding sources.(3)Regulatory barriers at the State and local levels, such as zoning and land use regulations, also inhibit the creation of new housing to meet local and regional housing needs.(4)State and local governments are proactively exploring solutions for reforming regulatory barriers, but additional resources, data, and models can help adequately address these challenges.(5)While land use regulation is the responsibility of State and local governments, there is Federal support for necessary reforms, and there is an opportunity for the Federal Government to provide support and assistance to State and local governments that wish to undertake necessary reforms in a manner that fits their communities’ needs.(6)Therefore, zoning ordinances or systems of land use regulation that have the intent or effect of restricting housing opportunities based on economic status or income without interests that are substantial, legitimate, nondiscriminatory and that outweigh the regional need for housing are contrary to the regional and national interest.(b)DefinitionsIn this section:(1)Affordable housingThe term affordable housing means housing for which the monthly payment is not more than 30 percent of the monthly income of the household.(2)Assistant SecretaryThe term Assistant Secretary means the Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research of the Department of Housing and Urban Development.(3)Local zoning frameworkThe term local zoning framework means the local zoning codes and other ordinances, procedures, and policies governing zoning and land-use at the local level.(4)SecretaryThe term Secretary means the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.(5)State zoning frameworkThe term State zoning framework means the State legislation or State agency and department procedures, or such legislation or procedures in an insular area of the United States, enabling local planning and zoning authorities and establishing and guiding related policies and programs.(c)Guidelines on State and local zoning frameworks(1)EstablishmentNot later than 3 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the Assistant Secretary shall publish documents outlining guidelines and best practices to support production of adequate housing to meet the needs of communities and provide housing opportunities for individuals at every income level across communities with respect to—(A)State zoning frameworks; and(B)local zoning frameworks.(2)Consultation; public commentDuring the 2-year period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, in developing the guidelines and best practices required under paragraph (1), the Assistant Secretary shall—(A)publish draft guidelines in the Federal Register for public comment;

This housing supply shortage has resulted in a record number of cost-burdened households across regions and spanning the large and small cities, towns, and coastal and rural communities of the United States.(2)Several factors contribute to the undersupply of housing in the United States, particularly workforce housing, including rising costs of construction, a shortage of labor, supply chain disruptions, and a lack of reliable funding sources.(3)Regulatory barriers at the State and local levels, such as zoning and land use regulations, also inhibit the creation of new housing to meet local and regional housing needs.(4)State and local governments are proactively exploring solutions for reforming regulatory barriers, but additional resources, data, and models can help adequately address these challenges.(5)While land use regulation is the responsibility of State and local governments, there is Federal support for necessary reforms, and there is an opportunity for the Federal Government to provide support and assistance to State and local governments that wish to undertake necessary reforms in a manner that fits their communities’ needs.(6)Therefore, zoning ordinances or systems of land use regulation that have the intent or effect of restricting housing opportunities based on economic status or income without interests that are substantial, legitimate, nondiscriminatory and that outweigh the regional need for housing are contrary to the regional and national interest.(b)DefinitionsIn this section:(1)Affordable housingThe term affordable housing means housing for which the monthly payment is not more than 30 percent of the monthly income of the household.(2)Assistant SecretaryThe term Assistant Secretary means the Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research of the Department of Housing and Urban Development.(3)Local zoning frameworkThe term local zoning framework means the local zoning codes and other ordinances, procedures, and policies governing zoning and land-use at the local level.(4)SecretaryThe term Secretary means the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.(5)State zoning frameworkThe term State zoning framework means the State legislation or State agency and department procedures, or such legislation or procedures in an insular area of the United States, enabling local planning and zoning authorities and establishing and guiding related policies and programs.(c)Guidelines on State and local zoning frameworks(1)EstablishmentNot later than 3 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the Assistant Secretary shall publish documents outlining guidelines and best practices to support production of adequate housing to meet the needs of communities and provide housing opportunities for individuals at every income level across communities with respect to—(A)State zoning frameworks;
