Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Securing Global Telecommunications Act.

Section 2:
2.Sense of congressIt is the sense of Congress as follows:
(1)The United States Government should promote and take steps to ensure American leadership in strategic technology industries, including telecommunications infrastructure and other information and communications technologies. (2)The expansive presence of companies linked to the Chinese Communist Party, such as Huawei, in global mobile networks and the national security implications thereof, such as the ability of the People’s Republic of China to exfiltrate the information flowing through those networks and shut off countries’ internet access, demonstrates the importance of the United States remaining at the technological frontier and the dire consequences of falling behind.
(3)The significant cost of countering Huawei’s market leadership in telecommunications infrastructure around the world underscores the urgency of supporting the competitiveness of United States companies in next-generation information and communication technology. (4)To remain a leader at the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and preserve the ITU’s technical integrity, the United States must work with emerging economies and developing nations to bolster global telecommunications security and protect American national security interests.
(5)Multilateral cooperation with like-minded partners and allies is critical to carry out the significant effort of financing and promoting secure networks around the world and to achieve market leadership of trusted vendors in this sector.
