(referred to in this preamble as the IDEA);Whereas the Department of Education Organization Act (20 U.S.C. 3401 et seq.), enacted in 1979, declares that the establishment of a Department of Education is in the public interest, will promote the general welfare of the United States, will help ensure that education issues receive proper treatment at the Federal level, and will enable the Federal Government to coordinate its education activities more effectively;Whereas the Department of Education serves approximately 100,000 public K–12 schools across the country, which collectively educate more than 49,000,000 students;Whereas reading and math scores and college degree attainment have substantially increased since the Department of Education was established;Whereas the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights enforces Federal laws prohibiting discrimination and harassment, and has investigated record numbers of incidents of discrimination and hate in recent years despite employing only about half of the staff the Office had when it was originally established;Whereas the Department of Education administers grants under the IDEA to help public schools serve more than 7,500,000 students with disabilities, a substantial financial commitment that cannot reasonably be assumed by State or local governments, and provides monitoring and oversight to hold States accountable for providing a free appropriate public education for students with disabilities;Whereas the Department of Education provides equitable supplementary funding through grants under part A of title I of the ESEA to more than 51,000 public schools serving concentrated populations of students from low-income families in rural, suburban, and urban communities;Whereas the Department of Education provides funding through subtitle B of title VII of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11431 et seq.) to support the identification, enrollment, attendance, and success of nearly 1,400,000 students experiencing homelessness;Whereas the Department of Education administers grants under part C of the IDEA to support the delivery of early intervention services to over 900,000 infants, toddlers, and preschoolers with disabilities;Whereas the Department of Education directly invests in the special education teachers of the United States through grants under part D of the IDEA to support personnel development to improve services and results for children with disabilities;Whereas the Department of Education supports parent training and information centers under part D of the IDEA to help students with disabilities and their families understand their rights and navigate the special education process;Whereas the Department of Education directly invests in people with disabilities to pursue post-secondary education, competitive, integrated employment, and independent living by providing vocational rehabilitation services through Title I of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 720 et seq.); Whereas the Department of Education provides protections from disability-based discrimination for students and staff in any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance, so all individuals with disabilities can access equal education and employment opportunities. Whereas the Department of Education provides funding under part F of title IV of the ESEA to support full-service community schools, which partner with local stakeholders, parents, and families to provide commonsense, locally-driven solutions to the challenges students and families face, and are another major step forward in reclaiming the promise of public education;Whereas the Department of Education provides vital support to thousands of rural school districts through the Rural Education Achievement program under part B of title V of the ESEA, which funds both the Small, Rural School Achievement grant program and the Rural and Low-Income School grant program;Whereas the Department of Education directly invests in the quality and effectiveness of nearly 90 percent of teachers and approximately 20 percent of school leaders nationwide through grants under part A of title II of the ESEA, ultimately improving retention rates, addressing the nationwide educator shortage, and improving student achievement;Whereas the Department of Education provides supplementary funding to help more than 5,000,000 English language learners achieve language proficiency and meet State academic standards through grants under part A of title III of the ESEA;Whereas the Department of Education provides supplementary funding to help tens of thousands of public schools provide well-rounded education, technology support, and school safety measures through grants under parts A, B, and F of title IV of the ESEA;Whereas the Department of Education provides funds to strengthen and support career and technical education programs for more than 8,200,000 secondary students across the country through title I of the Carl D.
