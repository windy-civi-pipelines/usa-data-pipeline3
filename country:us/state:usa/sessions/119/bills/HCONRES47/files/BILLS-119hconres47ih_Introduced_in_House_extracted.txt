IV119th CONGRESS1st SessionH. CON. RES. 47IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESSeptember 4, 2025Mr. Joyce of Pennsylvania submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Education and WorkforceCONCURRENT RESOLUTIONExpressing the sense of Congress regarding the public health, safety, and welfare implications of licensure of design professionals. 
Whereas the several States have traditionally licensed individuals in the practice of certain design occupations, with California having passed the first surveying licensure law in 1891, Illinois having passed the first architecture licensing law in 1897, and Wyoming having passed the first engineering licensure law in 1907; Whereas all 50 States, as well as territories and possessions, license individuals in the design profession disciplines; 
Whereas the National Transportation Safety Board has recognized the importance of professional licensing among certain design professions, most recently in NTSB/PSR–18/02, an incident safety report regarding a natural gas distribution system in the northeast region of the Merrimack Valley, Massachusetts; Whereas, more than 30 years ago, Congress recognized the importance of professional licensing in design disciplines in its report titled Structural Failures in Public Facilities (H. Rept. 98–61), which recommended all necessary architectural and engineering design and on-site services in public construction projects are furnished by licensed professionals who are qualified and experienced to assure the construction of safe structures; and 
Whereas many States are reducing requirements for, or eliminating the licensing of, certain occupations due to concerns over competition, market entry, and overregulation that do not serve the public interest, but in many cases the aforementioned State actions do not distinguish those professional design occupations in which licensing has a significant benefit to public health, safety, and welfare: Now, therefore, be it That it is the sense of Congress that— 
(1)occupations in design professions, including but not limited to architecture, engineering, surveying, and mapping, are essential to the integrity of the built and natural environment and critical to the successful research, planning, design, construction, development, alteration, repair, operation, and maintenance of real property, the Nation’s physical infrastructure, and resource planning activities, including the assessment, location, and development of critical materials, that contribute to maintaining the country’s economic prosperity, national security, and environmental protection; and (2)continuation of licensure of such occupations and professions by the several States is in the best interest of public health, safety, and welfare.
