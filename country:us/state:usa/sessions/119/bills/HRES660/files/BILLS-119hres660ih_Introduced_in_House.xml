<whereas><text>Whereas the United States has an incarceration crisis that has destabilized millions of Americans, caused intergenerational harm and trauma to families, decimated entire communities, and disproportionately impacted communities of color, particularly Black communities;</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas the Federal Government has an obligation to rebuild the American legal system so that it is smaller, safer, less punitive, and more humane;</text></whereas> 
<whereas><text>Whereas mass decarceration is a moral and societal imperative that the United States must strategically and effectively pursue;</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas the Federal Government manages the largest immigration detention system in the world, spends more resources on immigration enforcement than on all other Federal enforcement agencies combined, and now makes up the fastest growing incarceration system in the country;</text></whereas> 
<whereas><text>Whereas it should be the responsibility of the Federal Government to make America more free by dramatically reducing jail, prison, and immigration detention populations; make America more equal by eliminating racial disparities, wealth-based discrimination, and corporate profiteering; make America more secure by investing in the communities most destabilized by the failed policies of overpolicing and mass incarceration; and make America more just and humane by ensuring basic resources needed to feel safe are equitably provided to all people;</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas the American legal system duplicates and maintains systems of oppression that can be traced back to slavery, and as a result disproportionately harms Black communities throughout the United States;</text></whereas> 
<whereas><text>Whereas public safety is of paramount importance for every person, family, and community in this country;</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas a humane and effective justice system is a necessary predicate for a functioning and healthy democracy;</text></whereas> 
<whereas><text>Whereas, as recently as the early 1970s, the United States had an incarceration rate on par with most other Western democracies, and while their crime rates today are at nearly identical levels, America’s incarceration rate is five times higher;</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas the United States of America, a Nation purported to be founded on the principles of liberty and justice for all, has become the most incarcerated country in the world;</text></whereas>
