III119th CONGRESS1st SessionS. RES. 265IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATESJune 5, 2025Mr. Schumer (for himself, Mr. Reed, Mr. Warner, Mrs. Shaheen, and Mr. Coons) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign RelationsRESOLUTIONCondemning Russia’s devastating aerial bombardment on the people of Ukraine, particularly the use of increasingly advanced ballistic missiles, and expressing support for securing more air defense systems. Whereas, between January and May 2025, hundreds of Ukrainian civilians have been killed and injured in Russian ballistic missile attacks in Ukraine, including during the Palm Sunday attack on Sumy which killed 35 civilians and injured 113, and another attack in April on a playground in Kryvyi Rih that killed 20 people, including 9 children, and injured 75;Whereas the Government of Russia has employed ballistic missiles in its attacks on civilian infrastructure, obliterating over half of Ukraine’s power generation capacity, leaving hospitals, schools, and countless Ukrainian families without power, and risking nuclear catastrophe;Whereas North Korea has reportedly supplied Russia with approximately 250 ballistic missiles since fall 2024, and whereas, according to reports from Ukrainian air defense forces, Russia has used North Korean KN–23 missiles in 6 out of 9 ballistic attacks on Ukraine in May 2025;Whereas the range, speed, and power of Russia’s ballistic missiles, including their ground-launched short-range ballistic missile, hypersonic air-launched ballistic missile, and experimental intermediate-range ballistic missile, have allowed Russia to terrorize the people of Ukraine and damage the infrastructure that the civilian population relies on to sustain life under Russia’s aggression;Whereas, while Ukraine has successfully developed and employed domestically produced air defenses and Western assistance to counter drones and cruise missiles, defense against Russian ballistic missile attacks is only possible with sophisticated air defense systems, primarily the United States Army’s PATRIOT air defense system, augmented by a network of short- and medium-range air defense systems across the country;Whereas the cost and consistency of Russia’s ballistic missile attacks have rendered the unique need for comprehensive air defense systems a matter of life or death for the people of Ukraine; andWhereas Secretary of State Marco Rubio cited Ukraine’s request for additional air defenses in testimony to Congress on May 20, 2025: Now, therefore, be itThat the Senate—(1)condemns and rejects Russia’s illegal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and its continued attempts to militarily seize sovereign territory;(2)expresses continued solidarity with the people of Ukraine who are on the frontlines of the fight for freedom against Vladimir Putin;(3)calls on the President to take swift action to identify additional air defense systems, including advanced PATRIOT air defense systems and interceptors; National Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMs); radar guided air-to-air missiles (AMRAAMs); and other critical air defense systems within existing United States stocks for transfer to Ukraine to provide a layered defense against Russian attacks;(4)calls on the President to rapidly approve the reexport of United States air defense systems by our allies and partners to Ukraine, particularly the most advanced systems;(5)supports the continued and uninterrupted provision of United States security assistance, including training, advisory support, and intelligence regarding the disposition of Russian forces and location data to strengthen Ukraine’s hand in direct discussions with the Russian Federation to secure a lasting peace; and(6)reaffirms that it must remain the policy of the United States to provide sustainable levels of security assistance to Ukraine to provide a credible defense and deterrence capacity and support Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity, and democracy as outlined in the Bilateral Security Agreement signed by the United States and Ukraine on June 13, 2024.
