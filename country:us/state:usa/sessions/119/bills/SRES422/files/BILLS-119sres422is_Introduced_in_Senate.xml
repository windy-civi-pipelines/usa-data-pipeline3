 <text>Whereas PCOS can affect girls at the onset of puberty and throughout the remainder of their lives;</text>
        </whereas>
        <whereas>

        </whereas>
        <whereas>
 <text>Whereas women with PCOS have higher rates of mental health disorders, including depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and eating disorders, and are at greater risk for suicide;</text>
        </whereas>
        <whereas>
 <text>Whereas adolescents with PCOS often are not diagnosed, and many have metabolic dysfunction and insulin resistance, which can lead to type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obstructive sleep apnea, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, heart disease, and endometrial cancer at a young adult age;</text>
