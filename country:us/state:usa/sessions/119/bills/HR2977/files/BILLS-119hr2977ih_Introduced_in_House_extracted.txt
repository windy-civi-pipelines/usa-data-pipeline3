Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Mississippi River Restoration and Resilience Initiative Act or the MRRRI Act.

Section 2:
2.PurposeIt is the purpose of this Act to establish the Mississippi River Restoration and Resilience Initiative to protect and restore the ecological health and resilience of the Mississippi River for current and succeeding generations of Americans and for the fish and wildlife that rely on the Mississippi River and its floodplain.
