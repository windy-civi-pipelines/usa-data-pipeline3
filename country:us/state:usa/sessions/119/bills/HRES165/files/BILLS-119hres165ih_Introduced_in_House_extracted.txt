IV119th CONGRESS1st SessionH. RES. 165IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESFebruary 25, 2025Ms. Velázquez (for herself and Mr. Jackson of Illinois) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Oversight and Government ReformRESOLUTIONExpressing support for the designation of February 28, 2025, as Community Arts Education Day.
Whereas community arts education is a dynamic and inclusive approach to learning and engagement in the arts, fostering creativity, cultural expression, and social transformation within communities; Whereas community arts education encompasses a broad range of artistic disciplines and practices that empower individuals to develop their artistic skills, deepen their cultural understanding, and cultivate a sense of belonging and agency within themselves and their communities;
Whereas community arts education is a participatory and transformative practice that engages individuals in the creation, exploration, and critical dialogue of the arts within a community context, and community arts education goes beyond individual skill-building or personal expression and it connects through a larger social context; Whereas community arts education leaders, which can include culture bearers, teaching artists, and administrators, play a vital role in providing essential arts instruction and learning to diverse communities, both within and outside of formal educational settings;
Whereas community arts education is liberatory by uplifting our communities’ culture, heritage, and history in many forms such as dance, music, theatre, literary arts and other modes of self-expression; Whereas community arts education can build people’s imaginations, build critical learning and life skills, promote better health, and generate a sense of shared culture and community belonging;
Whereas research has shown that community arts education positively impacts individuals of all ages and develops social emotional competencies like confidence in self-expression and ideas, social awareness, and self-regulating emotions; and Whereas students who actively participate in the arts tend to enroll in competitive colleges, as well as four-year colleges in general, at higher rates compared to students with lower engagement in the arts: Now, therefore, be it 
That the House of Representatives supports Community Arts Education Day and recognizes Community Arts Education Day is more crucial than ever as a vehicle for activism, individual and collective self-expression, and healing.
