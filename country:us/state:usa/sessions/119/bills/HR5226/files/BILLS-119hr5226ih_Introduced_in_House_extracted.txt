Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Deceptive Downsizing Prohibition Act of 2025.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following: 
(1)Manufacturers of consumer products, including food, are reducing the size of such products while continuing to use packaging designed for the same or similar product of a larger size. (2)The practice of deceptive downsizing substantially harms consumers and reduces the purchasing power of consumers. 
(3)Consumers frequently do not appreciate or recognize that the size of a consumer product has changed until after the purchase, if ever. (4)The trend toward producing consumer products of reduced size without reducing the price has driven inflation, causing substantial injury to consumers that is not reasonably avoidable. 
(5)The Federal Government plays an essential role in protecting consumers from unfair or deceptive acts or practices, including ensuring manufacturers of consumer products do not deceive customers. (6)This Act shall protect consumers by prohibiting manufacturers of consumer products from selling such products, regardless of price or cost, of reduced size in packaging previously used for the same or similar product of a larger size. 
(7)Consumers need clear, conspicuous, and easily understandable notice of a change in the size of a consumer product and simply including the reduced size on the packaging without context or highlighting does not provide sufficient notice to consumers to avoid a violation of this Act.
