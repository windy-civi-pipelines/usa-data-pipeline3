(d) Development of Testbeds for measurement standards  (1) In general Not later than 2 years after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Director shall, in collaboration with the Secretary of Energy and in coordination with the Working Group, develop, in accordance with the strategy developed under subsection (c)(3)(A), testbeds on which to demonstrate the development of measurement standards for the evaluation of artificial intelligence systems to be used by Federal agencies.  
 (2) Experts In carrying out paragraph (1), the Director may hire any expert the Director considers necessary, including experts from academia, industry, and standards development organizations.    (e) Report Not later than 180 days after the date on which the Director completes the first testbed demonstration and development of measurement standards under subsection (d)(1), the Director shall submit to Congress a report that— 
 (1) reviews the findings of the Director with respect to the initial demonstration carried out under this section;   (2) recommends revisions to the pilot program plan, including by identifying any resources, funding, or personnel that is needed to improve and continue the development of testbeds and measurement standards for the evaluation of artificial intelligence systems for multiple applications; and
