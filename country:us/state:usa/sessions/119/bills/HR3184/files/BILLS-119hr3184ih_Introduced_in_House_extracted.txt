Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Protecting Firefighters and Advancing State-of-the-Art Alternatives Act or the PFAS Alternatives Act.

Section 2:
2.Preventing occupational illness and injury by expanding the availability of next-generation turnout gear (a)DefinitionsIn this section: 
(1)Eligible entityThe term eligible entity means a nonprofit organization, institution of higher education, national fire service organization, or national fire safety organization, as determined by the Secretary, with experience in not fewer than three of the following: (A)Conducting research on issues related to cancer and other occupational illnesses among firefighters. 
(B)Educating firefighters and other users of turnout gear on safe use, cleaning, and decontamination of turnout gear. (C)Educating firefighters on matters related to physical health, safety, and wellness. 
(D)Experience collaborating with other national nonprofit organizations to support research on firefighter safety and health. (E)Demonstrated ability to collaborate with researchers on matters related to firefighter health and safety. 
(F)Representing membership comprised of structural, wildfire, and aircraft firefighters and supervisors. (2)Moisture barrier materialsThe term moisture barrier material means the component of turnout gear that principally prevents the transfer of hazardous liquids, including hot liquids, fireground chemicals, and infectious fluids, and contributes to the overall thermal insulation of the firefighter without imposing undue burdens or otherwise compromising the performance of turnout gear. 
(3)PFASThe term PFAS means per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances that contain at least one fully fluorinated carbon atom or any other substance the Secretary determines appropriate. (4)SecretaryThe term Secretary means the Secretary of Health and Human Services. 
(5)Turnout gearThe term turnout gear means protective clothing worn as a main source of protection for firefighters and emergency medical services personnel during firefighting and post-fire operations to minimize exposure to hazards that cause serious injuries and illnesses that may result from contact with thermal, physical, chemical, biological, or other workplace hazards. Turnout gear— (A)includes protective clothing designed to protect firefighters performing structural firefighting, proximity firefighting, wildland firefighting, and urban interface firefighting; and 
(B)may also include other personal protective equipment referred to in section 33(c)(3)(I)(i) of the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 (15 U.S.C. 2229(c)(3)(I)(i)). (b)Research programs (1)In generalSubject to the availability of appropriations, not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, in consultation with the heads of other Federal agencies as appropriate, shall establish a program to award grants to eligible entities to support research, development, and testing of next-generation turnout gear and associated materials. 
(2)Requirements 
(A)PFAS-free componentsGrants awarded under this subsection shall support the research, development, and testing of materials to design and produce PFAS-free turnout gear. (B)PartnershipThe Secretary shall require that applications for grants under this subsection include a description of how the eligible entity will partner with organizations in, and relevant to, the firefighting industry, including organizations that directly represent members who serve in nonmanagerial firefighting roles, and how such partnership will help move the results of research, development, and testing described in subparagraph (A) into practice, including guidance and training for first responders and others who regularly use turnout gear. 
(3)ConsiderationsIn making awards under this subsection, the Secretary may consider the extent to which the activities proposed support the research, development, and testing described in subparagraph (A) that is likely to prevent occupational illness and injury for firefighters, including innovations that provide the following: (A)Enhanced protection against primary and secondary exposure to particulates and byproducts of combustion. 
(B)Reduced maintenance that includes contamination resistance and greater ease of cleaning or visible warning indicators to alert firefighters to hazardous exposures or the need for decontamination. (C)Consideration of body composition in development of prototypes and other products. 
(4)Authorization of appropriationsThere are authorized to be appropriated $25,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2025 through fiscal year 2029 to carry out this subsection. (c)Training programs (1)In generalSubject to the availability of appropriations, the Secretary, beginning in fiscal year 2027, shall award grants to, or enter into contracts or cooperative agreements with, eligible entities, as determined by the Secretary, to develop and disseminate guidance and training for firefighters and other first responders on best practices for reducing potentially harmful exposures by safely wearing, decontaminating, and caring for turnout gear developed in accordance with section (b). 
(2)Authorization of appropriationsThere are authorized to be appropriated $2,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2027 through fiscal year 2031 to carry out this subsection. (d)ReportNot later than two years after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report describing the progress made in achieving the goals under subsections (b) and (c).
