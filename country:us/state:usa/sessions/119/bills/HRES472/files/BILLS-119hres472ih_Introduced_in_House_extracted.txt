RES. 472IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESJune 4, 2025Mr. Fine (for himself, Mr. Pfluger, Ms. Tenney, Mr. Crenshaw, Mr. Rogers of Alabama, Mr. Weber of Texas, Mrs. McClain, Mr. Gooden, Mr. Owens, Mr. Collins, Mr. Taylor, Mr. Barrett, Mrs. Luna, Mr. Mills, Mr. Babin, Mr. Miller of Ohio, Mr. Goldman of Texas, Mr. Kustoff, Mr. Smith of New Jersey, and Mr. Biggs of Arizona) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Oversight and Government ReformRESOLUTIONCondemning the antisemitic terrorist attack in Boulder, Colorado. 
Whereas, on Sunday, June 1, 2025, 12 innocent American citizens were the subject of a coordinated terrorist attack meant to take the lives of Jewish Americans; Whereas those attacked ranged between the ages of 52 and 88, with one of the victims of the attack being a survivor of the Holocaust; 
Whereas the perpetrator of the attack, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, used Molotov cocktails and a makeshift flamethrower in an attempt to murder individuals specifically because of their Jewish heritage; Whereas Mohamed Soliman was reported to have yelled, Free Palestine, as he initiated his attack against a crowd of innocent Americans peacefully bringing awareness to the hostages that remain captive in Gaza; 
Whereas this heinous terrorist attack comes amidst an alarming rise in antisemitic violence sweeping the United States; Whereas, in the last 2 months alone, radical pro-Palestine activists have killed an engaged couple working at the Israeli Embassy and set fire to Governor Josh Shapiro’s home; and 
Whereas Mohamed Soliman had illegally overstayed his initial visa, and should have never been permitted to remain in the country as long as he was: Now, therefore, be it That the House of Representatives— 
(1)unequivocally condemns the antisemitic terrorist attack that took place against innocent Americans in Boulder, Colorado; (2)condemns antisemitism in all its forms, and expresses grave concern about the rise in antisemitic behavior and actions reported across college campuses, online, and in other public spaces; 
(3)prays for the swift and full recovery of all those injured in the attack, and expresses thanks to the police and emergency responders for their immediate action; (4)calls for the perpetrator of the terrorist attack to be prosecuted under the full extent of the law; and 
(5)urges Congress to take immediate action to secure the border and deport migrants who overstay their visas.
