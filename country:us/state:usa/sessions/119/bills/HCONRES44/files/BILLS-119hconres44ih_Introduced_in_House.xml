<whereas>
 <text>Whereas Congress approved the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970 and enacted the Clean Air Act (<external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/42/7401">42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.</external-xref>) to exercise the United States sovereign authority and duty to protect the air, water, lands, and seas of the United States from pollution that harms human health and welfare and the natural environment;</text>
    </whereas> 
<whereas><text>Whereas the administration of President Donald J. Trump exceeds its authority by directing Federal agencies, in violation of the Constitution and Acts of Congress, to unleash domestic fossil fuel production, while inhibiting the production of clean, renewable energy and electric vehicles, knowing that fossil fuel production will increase greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change and injure the children of the United States;</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas the Executive orders of President Trump that are being implemented by Federal agencies—</text>

<whereas><text>Whereas the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and President Trump are defying the Agency’s core mission to abate pollution and preserve <quote>the Earth as a place both habitable by and hospitable to [hu]man[s]</quote> as approved by Congress by disregarding its statutory mandates and permitting exemptions to emit hazardous air pollutants and promote fossil fuel development;</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas experts, including physicians and other public health experts, have found that President Trump’s Executive orders will increase air pollution and cause at least an additional 195,857 deaths over the next 25 years;</text></whereas>
