                (a)
                Study
 The Comptroller General of the United States shall conduct a study on the extent to which value-based purchasing arrangements (as defined in section 1927(k)(12) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396r–8(k)(12))) facilitate patient access to covered outpatient drugs, improve patient outcomes, lower overall health system costs, and lower costs for patients in Federal health care programs. In conducting such study, the Comptroller General shall—
                
                    (1)

 mitigating socioeconomic disparities in accessing covered outpatient drugs sold under value-based purchasing arrangements through its requirement that State Medicaid programs have access to the same value-based purchasing arrangement pricing structure that are available in the commercial market for such drugs;

                    (3)
 study the potential long-term savings for States that enter into such arrangements under State Medicaid programs.
