 Whereas Lafayette championed the ideals of liberty, advocated for the abolition of slavery in America and France, and co-authored the Declaration of the Rights of Man during the French Revolution;Whereas Lafayette was a lifetime abolitionist and an advocate for women’s rights, religious tolerance, and freedom of the press;Whereas Lafayette was invited by Congress and President James Monroe to return to America as an official Guest of the Nation, and the ensuing farewell tour cemented his status as a beloved national hero; Whereas, from August 1824 to September 1825, Lafayette traveled over 6,000 miles, visited all 24 States that were in the Union at the time, and nearly half of the citizens of the United States saw Lafayette during his farewell tour;
 Whereas, on December 10, 1824, Lafayette became the first foreign dignitary to address the United States Congress;Whereas, on September 6, 1825, on Lafayette’s 68th birthday, he was hosted by President John Quincy Adams for a state dinner at the White House, his last visit to the Executive Residence;Whereas Lafayette’s unwavering commitment to American independence, democracy, and human rights has left an indelible mark on the Nation’s identity, earning him enduring gratitude and the title Hero of Two Worlds;Whereas a portrait of Lafayette, given to the House of Representatives, was first displayed in 1825 and now hangs in the House Chamber opposite the portrait of George Washington; and Whereas the American Friends of Lafayette organized the Lafayette Farewell Tour Bicentennial from August 2024–September 2025, a 13-month, 24-State, 350 event commemoration to educate all Americans about Lafayette’s contributions to the country’s founding, his lifetime passion for human rights, and the importance of the Franco-American Alliance: Now, therefore, be it
