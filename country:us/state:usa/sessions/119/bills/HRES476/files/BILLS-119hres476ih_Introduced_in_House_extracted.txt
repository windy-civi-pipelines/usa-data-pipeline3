Whereas antisemitic violence threatens lives and violates the core values of the United States; Whereas Federal, State, and local officials, along with community leaders, have condemned the attack, reaffirming a shared commitment to ensuring the safety of Jewish Americans and all communities targeted by hate; 
Whereas law enforcement officials, including the Boulder Police Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, responded swiftly and continue to investigate the incident to bring the perpetrator to justice; Whereas the Boulder and Denver-based chapter of the Run for Their Lives plans to continue walking each Sunday, despite the terror attack against members of the Boulder chapter, to show solidarity and to continue calling for the release of the hostages in Gaza; and 
Whereas elected officials and community leaders in Boulder have called on residents to unite in support of the survivors and to reject antisemitism and extremism in all forms: Now, therefore, be it That the House of Representatives—
