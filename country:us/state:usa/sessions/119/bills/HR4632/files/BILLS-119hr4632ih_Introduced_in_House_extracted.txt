206.Exception for States in which use of multi-member or at large districts will result in diminishment of voting rights (a)ExceptionIf, in an action brought under section 306, the court determines that the use of multi-member or at large districts by a State, as set forth in the congressional redistricting plan of a State with respect to the apportionment of Representatives resulting from a decennial census, indicates that the redistricting plan will deny or abridge the right to vote by having the effect of diminishing the ability of any citizens of the United States on account of race or color, or in contravention of the guarantees set forth in section 4(f)(2) of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 10303(f)(2)), to elect their preferred candidates of choice—

Section 22:
303.Criteria for redistricting 
(a)Ranked criteriaThe redistricting plan of a State shall be developed in accordance with the following criteria, as set forth in the following order of priority: (1)Districts shall comply with the Constitution of the United States, including the requirement that they substantially equalize total population, without regard to age, citizenship status, or immigration status. 
(2)Districts shall comply with the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 10301 et seq.), and all applicable Federal laws. (3) (A)Districts shall be drawn, to the extent that the totality of the circumstances warrant, to ensure the practical ability of a group protected under the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 10301 et seq.), whether alone or in coalition with others, to participate in the political process and to nominate candidates and to elect representatives of choice is not diluted or diminished. 
(B)For purposes of subparagraph (A), the assessment of whether a protected group has the practical ability to nominate candidates and to elect representatives of choice shall require the consideration of the following factors: (i)Whether the group is politically cohesive. 
(ii)Whether there is racially polarized voting in the relevant geographic region. (iii)If there is racially polarized voting in the relevant geographic region, whether the preferred candidates of the group nevertheless receive a sufficient amount of consistent crossover support from other voters such that the group has a real opportunity to both nominate candidates and elect representatives of choice. 
(4)To the extent practicable, districts shall reflect the diversity of political opinion in the State such that no district in the State— (A)elects exactly 3 Representatives and the nominee of one political party for President received at least 75 percent of the votes cast in the geographic area covered by the district in 2 of the 3 most recent Presidential elections; 
(B)elects exactly 4 Representatives and the nominee of one political party for President received at least 80 percent of the votes cast in the geographic area covered by the district in 2 of the 3 most recent Presidential elections; or (C)elects exactly 5 Representatives and the nominee of one political party for President received at least 83 percent of the votes cast in the geographic area covered by the district in 2 of the 3 most recent Presidential elections. 
(5)To the greatest extent practicable the State shall minimize the number of districts electing 4 Representatives. (6)To the greatest extent practicable the State shall maximize the number of districts electing 5 Representatives. 
(7) 
(A)Districts shall be drawn to represent communities of interest and neighborhoods to the extent practicable after compliance with the requirements of paragraphs (1) through (6). A community of interest is defined as an area for which the record before the entity responsible for developing and adopting the redistricting plan demonstrates the existence of broadly shared interests and representational needs, including shared interests and representational needs rooted in common ethnic, racial, economic, Indian, social, cultural, geographic, or historic identities, or arising from similar socioeconomic conditions. The term communities of interest may, if the record warrants, include political subdivisions such as counties, municipalities, Indian lands, or school districts, but shall not include common relationships with political parties or political candidates. (B)For purposes of subparagraph (A), in considering the needs of multiple, overlapping communities of interest, the entity responsible for developing and adopting the redistricting plan shall give greater weight to those communities of interest whose representational needs would most benefit from the community’s inclusion in a single congressional district. 
(b)No favoring or disfavoring of political parties 
(1)ProhibitionA State may not use a redistricting plan to conduct an election if the plan’s congressional districts, when considered cumulatively on a statewide basis, have been drawn with the intent or have the effect of materially favoring or disfavoring any political party. (2)Determination of effectThe determination of whether a redistricting plan has the effect of materially favoring or disfavoring a political party shall be based on an evaluation of the totality of circumstances which, at a minimum, shall involve consideration of each of the following factors: 
(A)Computer modeling based on relevant statewide general elections for Federal office held over the 8 years preceding the adoption of the redistricting plan setting forth the probable electoral outcomes for the plan under a range of reasonably foreseeable conditions. (B)An analysis of whether the redistricting plan is statistically likely to result in partisan advantage or disadvantage on a statewide basis, the degree of any such advantage or disadvantage, and whether such advantage or disadvantage is likely to be present under a range of reasonably foreseeable electoral conditions. 
(C)A comparison of the modeled electoral outcomes for the redistricting plan to the modeled electoral outcomes for alternative plans that demonstrably comply with the requirements of paragraphs (1) through (6) of subsection (a) in order to determine whether reasonable alternatives exist that would result in materially lower levels of partisan advantage or disadvantage on a statewide basis. For purposes of this subparagraph, alternative plans considered may include both actual plans proposed during the redistricting process and other plans prepared for purposes of comparison. (D)Any other relevant information, including how broad support for the redistricting plan was among members of the entity responsible for developing and adopting the plan and whether the processes leading to the development and adoption of the plan were transparent and equally open to all members of the entity and to the public. 
(3)Determination of intentA court may rely on all available evidence when determining whether a redistricting plan was drawn with the intent to materially favor or disfavor a political party, including evidence of the partisan effects of a plan, the degree of support the plan received from members of the entity responsible for developing and adopting the plan, and whether the processes leading to development and adoption of the plan were transparent and equally open to all members of the entity and to the public. (4)No violation based on certain criteriaNo redistricting plan shall be found to be in violation of paragraph (1) because of the proper application of the criteria set forth in paragraphs (1) through (6) of subsection (a), unless one or more alternative plans could have complied with such paragraphs without having the effect of materially favoring or disfavoring a political party. 
(c)Factors prohibited from considerationIn developing the redistricting plan for the State, the State may not take into consideration any of the following factors, except as necessary to comply with the criteria described in paragraphs (1) through (6) of subsection (a), to achieve partisan fairness and comply with subsection (b), and to enable the redistricting plan to be measured against the external metrics described in section 304(c): (1)The residence of any Member of the House of Representatives, candidate, or any other individual who is eligible to serve as a Member of the House of Representatives from the State. 
(2)The political party affiliation or voting history of the population of a district. (d)Additional criteriaA State may not rely upon criteria, districting principles, or other policies of the State which are not set forth in this section to justify non-compliance with the requirements of this section. 
(e)Applicability 
(1)In generalThis section applies to any authority, whether appointed, elected, judicial, or otherwise, responsible for enacting the congressional redistricting plan of a State. (2)Date of enactmentThis section applies to any congressional redistricting plan enacted following the regular decennial census conducted during 2030. 
(f)Severability of criteriaIf any provision of this section, or the application of any such provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be unconstitutional, the remainder of this section, and the application of such provision to any other person or circumstance, shall not be affected by the holding.

IRanked Choice Voting 
101.Requiring ranked choice voting for election of Senators and Representatives 
(a)In generalTitle III of the Help America Vote Act of 2001 (52 U.S.C. 21081 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following new subtitle:  CRanked Choice Voting 1Requiring Ranked Choice Voting for Election of Senators and Representatives 321.Requiring ranked choice voting for election of Senators and Representatives (a)Ranked choice votingExcept as provided in section 205 of the Fair Representation Act, each State shall carry out elections for the office of Senator and the office of Representative in Congress using ranked choice voting, a system under which each voter may rank the candidates for the office in the order of the voter’s preference, and ballots are tabulated, in accordance with the following: 
(1)In any single-seat election and any election for the office of Senator, the State shall carry out the election using single-seat ranked choice voting as described in section 322(a). (2)In any multi-seat election, the State shall carry out the election using multi-seat ranked choice voting as described in section 322(b). 
(b)Ballot design 
(1)In generalEach State shall ensure that the ballot used in an ranked choice voting election under this title meets each of the following requirements: (A)The ballot shall allow voters to rank candidates in order of choice. 
(B)The number of candidates whom a voter may rank in the election, as determined under paragraph (2), shall be uniform for all voters in the election within the State. (C)The ballot shall include all qualified candidates for the election and (to the extent permitted under State law) options for voters to select write-in candidates. 
(D)The ballot shall include such instructions as the State considers necessary to enable the voter to rank candidates and successfully cast the ballot under the system. (2)Determination of number of candidates voter may rankThe number of candidates a voter may rank in a ranked choice voting election shall be determined as follows: 
(A)If feasible, the ballot shall permit voters to rank a number of candidates in the election which is not fewer than the number of seats in the election plus 4. (B)If the number of candidates in the election is less than the number of ranking provided under subparagraph (A), the ballot shall permit voters to rank a number of candidates which is not fewer than the number of candidates in the election, including write-in candidates. 
(C)If it is not feasible for the ballot to permit voters to rank as many candidates as required under subparagraphs (A) or (B), the State may limit the number of candidates who may be ranked for each election on the ballot to a maximum feasible number established by the State, except that such number may not be less than 5 for any election on the ballot. 322.Tabulation of ballots (a)Tabulation for single-Seat congressional elections (1)Process for tabulationIn the case of a single-seat election, each ballot cast in the election shall count as one vote for the highest-ranked active candidate on the ballot. Tabulation shall proceed in rounds as described in paragraphs (2) and (3). 
(2)Elimination of candidates during tabulationIf there are more than two active candidates, the active candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, each vote cast on a ballot for the eliminated candidate shall be counted for the next-ranked active candidate on the ballot, and a new round shall begin. (3)Completion of tabulation; election of candidateWhen there are two or fewer active candidates— 
(A)tabulation is complete; and (B)the candidate receiving the greatest number of votes shall be elected to the office of Senator or Representative in Congress (or, in the case of a primary election, shall advance to the general election for such office as provided under the law of the State involved). 
(b)Tabulation for multi-Seat congressional elections— (1)Process for tabulationIn the case of a multi-seat election, each ballot cast in the election shall count at its current transfer value for the highest-ranked active candidate on the ballot. Tabulation shall proceed as described in paragraphs (2), (3), and (4). 
(2)Election of candidates during tabulation; surplus-transfer roundIf any active candidate has a number of votes greater than or equal to the election threshold, that candidate shall be designated as elected, and the surplus votes shall be transferred to other candidates as follows: (A)Unless paragraph (4) applies, each ballot counting for an elected candidate shall be assigned a new transfer value by multiplying the ballot’s current transfer value by the surplus fraction for the elected candidate, truncated after 4 decimal places. 
(B)Each candidate elected under this paragraph shall be deemed to have a number of votes equal to the election threshold for the contest in all future rounds, each ballot counting towards the elected candidate shall be transferred at its new transfer value to its next-ranked active candidate, and a new round shall begin. (C)If two or more candidates have a number of votes greater than the election threshold, the surpluses shall be distributed simultaneously in the same round. 
(3)Elimination of candidates during tabulation; elimination roundUnless paragraph (2) or paragraph (4) applies, the active candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, each vote cast on a ballot for the eliminated candidate shall be counted for the next-ranked active candidate on the ballot, and a new round shall begin. (4)Completion of tabulationTabulation in a multi-seat election is complete if— 
(A)the number of elected candidates is equal to the number of seats to be filled and any remaining votes in excess of the election threshold have been counted for each ballot’s next-ranked active candidate; or (B)the sum of the number of elected candidates and the number of active candidates is less than or equal to the number of seats to be filled at any time. 
(c)Treatment of certain ballots 
(1)Treatment of undervotesA ballot which is an undervote shall not be counted in any round of tabulation of ballots in an election under this section. For purposes of this paragraph, an undervote is a ballot for which the voter does not rank any of the candidates in the election. (2)Treatment of inactive ballots (A)In generalA ballot which becomes an inactive ballot shall no longer count for any candidate for the remainder of the tabulation of ballots in an election under this section after the ballot becomes inactive. 
(B)Inactive ballot definedFor purposes of this paragraph, an inactive ballot is a ballot on which— (i)all of the ranked candidates on the ballot have become inactive; or 
(ii)the voter ranks more than one candidate at the same ranking and all candidates at a higher ranking have become inactive. (3)Treatment of skipped or repeated rankings (A)In generalA ballot which includes any skipped or repeated ranking shall remain active and continue to be counted for the highest-ranked active candidate in an election under this section. 
(B)Skipped and repeated rankings definedFor purposes of this paragraph— (i)a skipped ranking is a ranking a voter does not assign to any candidate while assigning a subsequent ranking to a candidate; and 
(ii)a repeated ranking is a ranking for which the voter has assigned the same candidate that the voter assigned to another ranking. 323.Treatment of ties between candidates (a)Resolution by lotIf a tie occurs between candidates with the greatest number of votes or the fewest number of votes at any point in the tabulation of ballots under this part and the tabulation cannot proceed until the tie is resolved, the tie shall be resolved by lot or by such other method as may be provided under State law. 
(b)Resolution prior to tabulationPrior to tabulation, the chief election official of the State may resolve prospective ties between candidates by lot or according to the method provided under State law, as described in subsection (a). (c)Use during recountThe result of the resolution of any tie shall be recorded and reused for purposes of any recount under State law.

(2)The term election threshold means the number of votes sufficient for a candidate to be elected in a multi-seat election. Such number is equal to the total votes counted for active candidates in the first round of tabulation, divided by the sum of one plus the number of seats to be filled, then increased by one, disregarding any fractions. (3)The term highest-ranked active candidate means the active candidate assigned to a higher ranking than any other active candidate. 
(4)The term multi-seat election means any primary election in which more than one candidate in the primary election will advance to the general election, any special election for more than one seat, and any general election in which more than one Representative is elected at large or in a multi-member district.

(6)The term single-seat election means any primary election in which exactly one candidate in the primary election will advance to the general election, any special election for exactly one seat, any general election for the office of Senator, and any general election in which only one Representative is elected at large. (7)The term surplus fraction means, with respect to an elected candidate as described in section 322(b)(1), the number obtained by subtracting the election threshold from the candidate’s vote total, then dividing that number by the candidate’s vote total, truncated after four decimal places. 
(8)The term transfer value means the proportion of a vote that a ballot will contribute to its highest-ranked active candidate. Each ballot begins with a transfer value of 1. If a ballot contributes to the election of a candidate under section 322(b)(1), the transfer value shall be the new transfer value assigned under such section. (9)The term vote total means, with respect to a candidate in a round of counting, the total transfer value of all ballots counting for the candidate in the round. 
(10)The term withdrawn candidate means a candidate who, prior to the date of the election, files or has an authorized designee file a signed letter of withdrawal from the election, in accordance with such rules as the chief election official of the State may establish. 2Payments to States to Implement Ranked Choice Voting 331.Payments to States to implement ranked choice voting (a)Payments described (1)PaymentsNot later than June 1, 2026, the Commission shall make a payment to each State in the amount determined with respect to the State under paragraph (2).

IIINonpartisan Redistricting Reform 
301.Requiring congressional redistricting plans to comply with nonpartisan criteriaA State may not use a congressional redistricting plan enacted if such plan is not in compliance with section 303. 302.Ban on mid-decade redistrictingA State that has been redistricted in accordance with this title may not be redistricted again until after the next apportionment of Representatives under section 22(a) of the Act entitled An Act to provide for the fifteenth and subsequent decennial censuses and to provide for an apportionment of Representatives in Congress, approved June 18, 1929 (2 U.S.C. 2a), unless a court requires the State to conduct such subsequent redistricting to comply with the Constitution of the United States, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 10301 et seq.), or the terms or conditions of this title. 
303.Criteria for redistricting 
(a)Ranked criteriaThe redistricting plan of a State shall be developed in accordance with the following criteria, as set forth in the following order of priority: (1)Districts shall comply with the Constitution of the United States, including the requirement that they substantially equalize total population, without regard to age, citizenship status, or immigration status. 
(2)Districts shall comply with the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 10301 et seq.), and all applicable Federal laws. (3) (A)Districts shall be drawn, to the extent that the totality of the circumstances warrant, to ensure the practical ability of a group protected under the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 10301 et seq.), whether alone or in coalition with others, to participate in the political process and to nominate candidates and to elect representatives of choice is not diluted or diminished. 
(B)For purposes of subparagraph (A), the assessment of whether a protected group has the practical ability to nominate candidates and to elect representatives of choice shall require the consideration of the following factors: (i)Whether the group is politically cohesive. 
(ii)Whether there is racially polarized voting in the relevant geographic region. (iii)If there is racially polarized voting in the relevant geographic region, whether the preferred candidates of the group nevertheless receive a sufficient amount of consistent crossover support from other voters such that the group has a real opportunity to both nominate candidates and elect representatives of choice. 
(4)To the extent practicable, districts shall reflect the diversity of political opinion in the State such that no district in the State— (A)elects exactly 3 Representatives and the nominee of one political party for President received at least 75 percent of the votes cast in the geographic area covered by the district in 2 of the 3 most recent Presidential elections; 
(B)elects exactly 4 Representatives and the nominee of one political party for President received at least 80 percent of the votes cast in the geographic area covered by the district in 2 of the 3 most recent Presidential elections; or (C)elects exactly 5 Representatives and the nominee of one political party for President received at least 83 percent of the votes cast in the geographic area covered by the district in 2 of the 3 most recent Presidential elections. 
(5)To the greatest extent practicable the State shall minimize the number of districts electing 4 Representatives. (6)To the greatest extent practicable the State shall maximize the number of districts electing 5 Representatives. 
(7) 
(A)Districts shall be drawn to represent communities of interest and neighborhoods to the extent practicable after compliance with the requirements of paragraphs (1) through (6). A community of interest is defined as an area for which the record before the entity responsible for developing and adopting the redistricting plan demonstrates the existence of broadly shared interests and representational needs, including shared interests and representational needs rooted in common ethnic, racial, economic, Indian, social, cultural, geographic, or historic identities, or arising from similar socioeconomic conditions. The term communities of interest may, if the record warrants, include political subdivisions such as counties, municipalities, Indian lands, or school districts, but shall not include common relationships with political parties or political candidates. (B)For purposes of subparagraph (A), in considering the needs of multiple, overlapping communities of interest, the entity responsible for developing and adopting the redistricting plan shall give greater weight to those communities of interest whose representational needs would most benefit from the community’s inclusion in a single congressional district. 
(b)No favoring or disfavoring of political parties 
(1)ProhibitionA State may not use a redistricting plan to conduct an election if the plan’s congressional districts, when considered cumulatively on a statewide basis, have been drawn with the intent or have the effect of materially favoring or disfavoring any political party. (2)Determination of effectThe determination of whether a redistricting plan has the effect of materially favoring or disfavoring a political party shall be based on an evaluation of the totality of circumstances which, at a minimum, shall involve consideration of each of the following factors: 
(A)Computer modeling based on relevant statewide general elections for Federal office held over the 8 years preceding the adoption of the redistricting plan setting forth the probable electoral outcomes for the plan under a range of reasonably foreseeable conditions. (B)An analysis of whether the redistricting plan is statistically likely to result in partisan advantage or disadvantage on a statewide basis, the degree of any such advantage or disadvantage, and whether such advantage or disadvantage is likely to be present under a range of reasonably foreseeable electoral conditions. 
(C)A comparison of the modeled electoral outcomes for the redistricting plan to the modeled electoral outcomes for alternative plans that demonstrably comply with the requirements of paragraphs (1) through (6) of subsection (a) in order to determine whether reasonable alternatives exist that would result in materially lower levels of partisan advantage or disadvantage on a statewide basis. For purposes of this subparagraph, alternative plans considered may include both actual plans proposed during the redistricting process and other plans prepared for purposes of comparison. (D)Any other relevant information, including how broad support for the redistricting plan was among members of the entity responsible for developing and adopting the plan and whether the processes leading to the development and adoption of the plan were transparent and equally open to all members of the entity and to the public. 
(3)Determination of intentA court may rely on all available evidence when determining whether a redistricting plan was drawn with the intent to materially favor or disfavor a political party, including evidence of the partisan effects of a plan, the degree of support the plan received from members of the entity responsible for developing and adopting the plan, and whether the processes leading to development and adoption of the plan were transparent and equally open to all members of the entity and to the public. (4)No violation based on certain criteriaNo redistricting plan shall be found to be in violation of paragraph (1) because of the proper application of the criteria set forth in paragraphs (1) through (6) of subsection (a), unless one or more alternative plans could have complied with such paragraphs without having the effect of materially favoring or disfavoring a political party. 
(c)Factors prohibited from considerationIn developing the redistricting plan for the State, the State may not take into consideration any of the following factors, except as necessary to comply with the criteria described in paragraphs (1) through (6) of subsection (a), to achieve partisan fairness and comply with subsection (b), and to enable the redistricting plan to be measured against the external metrics described in section 304(c): (1)The residence of any Member of the House of Representatives, candidate, or any other individual who is eligible to serve as a Member of the House of Representatives from the State. 
(2)The political party affiliation or voting history of the population of a district. (d)Additional criteriaA State may not rely upon criteria, districting principles, or other policies of the State which are not set forth in this section to justify non-compliance with the requirements of this section. 
(e)Applicability
