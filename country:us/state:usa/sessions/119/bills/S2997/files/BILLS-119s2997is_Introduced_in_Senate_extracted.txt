                    In general
 In any case in which a State attorney general or a State privacy regulator has reason to believe that an interest of the residents of a State has been or is adversely affected by any covered entity that violates any provision of this Act, the State attorney general or State privacy regulator, as parens patriae, may bring a civil action on behalf of the residents of the State in an appropriate State court or an appropriate district court of the United States to—
                    
                        (1)

 Before initiating a civil action under subsection (a), the State attorney general or State privacy regulator, as the case may be, shall notify the Secretary in writing of such civil action. Upon receiving such notice, the Secretary may—
                    
                        (1)

In a case brought by the Secretary that affects the interests of a State, the State attorney general or State privacy regulator may intervene as of right pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
                
                
                    (d)
                    Preservation of State powers
 Except as provided in subsection (c), no provision of this Act shall be construed as altering, limiting, or affecting the authority of a State attorney general or State privacy regulator to—
                    
                        (1)
