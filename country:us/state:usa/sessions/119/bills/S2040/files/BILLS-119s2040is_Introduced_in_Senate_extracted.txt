                                        In general

                                            (i)
 to set forth in detail why the alleged violator either believes that a violation of subsection (a) did not occur or why a civil monetary penalty under subsection (c)(1)(A) is otherwise unwarranted under the circumstances; and

 A representative of the alleged violator may act on behalf of the alleged violator, but any oral communication with the Secretary prior to a written submission regarding the specific allegations contained in the pre-penalty notice is required to be preceded by a written letter of representation, unless the pre-penalty notice was served upon the alleged violator in care of the representative.

 If, after considering any written response to a pre-penalty notice under subsection (d)(2) and any relevant facts, including voluntary disclosure of a violation of subsection (a), the Secretary determines that there was a violation by the alleged violator named in the pre-penalty notice and that a civil monetary penalty under subsection (c)(1)(A) is appropriate, the Secretary may issue a penalty notice to the violator containing a determination of the violation and the imposition of the monetary penalty.

A digital signature is acceptable.

                                            (i)
 to set forth in detail why the alleged violator either believes that a violation of subsection (a) did not occur or why a civil monetary penalty under subsection (c)(1)(A) is otherwise unwarranted under the circumstances; and
                                        
                                        
                                            (ii)

                                    Representation
 A representative of the alleged violator may act on behalf of the alleged violator, but any oral communication with the Secretary prior to a written submission regarding the specific allegations contained in the pre-penalty notice is required to be preceded by a written letter of representation, unless the pre-penalty notice was served upon the alleged violator in care of the representative.

                                    Settlement
 Settlement discussions may be initiated by the Secretary, the alleged violator, or the alleged violator's authorized representative.

 If, after considering any written response to a pre-penalty notice under subsection (d)(2) and any relevant facts, including voluntary disclosure of a violation of subsection (a), the Secretary determines that there was a violation by the alleged violator named in the pre-penalty notice and that a civil monetary penalty under subsection (c)(1)(A) is appropriate, the Secretary may issue a penalty notice to the violator containing a determination of the violation and the imposition of the monetary penalty.
                                
                                
                                    (2)
                                    Final agency action
 The issuance of the penalty notice shall constitute final agency action for purposes of review under section 704 of title 5, United States Code.

                                        In general
 If the Secretary has reason to believe that there has occurred a violation of subsection (a) and determines that a civil monetary penalty under subsection (c)(1)(A) is warranted, the Secretary shall issue a pre-penalty notice informing the alleged violator of the intent of the Secretary to impose a monetary penalty. The Secretary shall consider any voluntary disclosures of a violation before issuing such notice.

A digital signature is acceptable.

                                            (i)
 to set forth in detail why the alleged violator either believes that a violation of subsection (a) did not occur or why a civil monetary penalty under subsection (c)(1)(A) is otherwise unwarranted under the circumstances; and
                                        
                                        
                                            (ii)

                                    Representation
 A representative of the alleged violator may act on behalf of the alleged violator, but any oral communication with the Secretary prior to a written submission regarding the specific allegations contained in the pre-penalty notice is required to be preceded by a written letter of representation, unless the pre-penalty notice was served upon the alleged violator in care of the representative.

                                    Settlement

 If, after considering any written response to a pre-penalty notice under subsection (d)(2) and any relevant facts, including voluntary disclosure of a violation of subsection (a), the Secretary determines that there was a violation by the alleged violator named in the pre-penalty notice and that a civil monetary penalty under subsection (c)(1)(A) is appropriate, the Secretary may issue a penalty notice to the violator containing a determination of the violation and the imposition of the monetary penalty.

                                    Final agency action
 The issuance of the penalty notice shall constitute final agency action for purposes of review under section 704 of title 5, United States Code.

 The violator may seek judicial review of that final agency action under section 1785G.
