This is critically important, not only for the present state of readiness in the Armed Forces, but for potential recruitment of future warfighters as elucidated by President George Washington when he stated, <quote>The willingness with which our young people are likely to serve in any war, no matter how justified, shall be directly proportional to how they perceive veterans of early wars were treated and appreciated by our nation.</quote>.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HC6D4AF7B4092422A845C3336470E4228"><enum>(2)</enum><text>Wounded Warriors remain members of an Armed Force under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of a military department and determinations regarding their physical ability is the responsibility of the chain of command of the member, rather than the personnel within or under the direction of the Defense Health Agency.
