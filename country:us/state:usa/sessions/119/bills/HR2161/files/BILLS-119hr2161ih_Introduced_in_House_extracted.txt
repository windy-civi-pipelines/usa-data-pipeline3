1131.DefinitionsIn this chapter the following definitions apply: (1)Prohibited human-animal chimeraThe term prohibited human-animal chimera means—
(A)a human embryo into which a nonhuman cell or cells (or the component parts thereof) have been introduced to render the embryo’s membership in the species Homo sapiens uncertain; (B)a human-animal embryo produced by fertilizing a human egg with nonhuman sperm;
(C)a human-animal embryo produced by fertilizing a nonhuman egg with human sperm; (D)an embryo produced by introducing a nonhuman nucleus into a human egg;
(E)an embryo produced by introducing a human nucleus into a nonhuman egg; (F)an embryo containing at least haploid sets of chromosomes from both a human and a nonhuman life form;
(G)a nonhuman life form engineered such that human gametes develop within the body of a nonhuman life form;  (H)a nonhuman life form engineered such that it contains a human brain or a brain derived wholly or predominantly from human neural tissues;
(I) a nonhuman life form engineered such that it exhibits human facial features or other bodily morphologies to resemble human features; or (J)an embryo produced by mixing human and nonhuman cells, such that—
(i)human gametes develop within the body of the resultant organism; (ii)it contains a human brain or a brain derived wholly or predominantly from human neural tissues; or
(iii)it exhibits human facial features or other bodily morphologies to resemble human features. (2)Human embryoThe term human embryo means an organism of the species Homo sapiens during the earliest stages of development, from 1 cell up to 8 weeks.
