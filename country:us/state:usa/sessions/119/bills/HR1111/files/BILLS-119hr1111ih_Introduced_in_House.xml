In 2024, UNICEF warned that rape and gender-based violence are often used as weapons of war and that 1 out of every 8 girls alive today—some 370 million people—will experience rape or sexual assault before they turn 18. More than 120 million individuals have been forcibly displaced worldwide as a result of persecution, conflict, violence, and human rights violations.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HC4DDC22E5D5940DE8E6BA601971E420B"><enum>(5)</enum><text>In the 21st century, the United States has spent almost $8 trillion on foreign wars, with nearly 5 million lives lost.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H020EDDE1ED084D2B9F08BBC2CD7C7F05"><enum>(6)</enum><text>The physical, emotional, monetary, and other costs of violence are enormous, cut across all sectors of society in the United States, disproportionately impact people of color, and are interrelated.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HD1FC2F6E99FD4CFDAA75A1F71469A405" commented="no"><enum>(7)</enum><text>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health report 1 in 7 children experience some form of child abuse or neglect in their lifetimes, nearly 1 in 4 women report having experienced severe physical violence from an intimate partner, nearly 1 in 3 women and 1 in 7 men experience some form of sexual violence during their lifetimes, and Native American women are sexually assaulted, murdered, and disappeared at higher rates than other American women. Additionally, the lifetime economic cost associated with medical services for Intimate Partner Violence-related injuries, lost productivity from paid work, criminal justice and other costs, is $3.6 trillion according to the CDC.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H09E01D1B1303439D9FC1B561853BF2FA"><enum>(8)</enum><text>There are 3.3 million reports of violence against children that result in foster care placements every year; 25 percent of kids in foster care experience PTSD, fewer than 3 percent earn a college degree; 20 percent become homeless after the age of 18; and only 50 percent will be employed by the age of 24. One in five high school students reported being bullied at school during 2017 and cyberbullying impacts many young people. Criminalization disproportionately impacts African Americans and other people of color, including high rates of school suspensions and expulsions and incarceration. African Americans are incarcerated at more than five times the rate of Whites.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H32F7CF871B7C49EABFCF6BB1F1B8918B"><enum>(9)</enum><text>In 2015, 17 percent of students considered attempting suicide.

Firearms are the leading cause of death for American children and teens, disproportionally affecting people of color, and cause more deaths in young people than cancer and car crashes. The Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Prevention reports that in 2022, 48,204 people died due to gun violence in the United States, the second highest total ever recorded. Each day, an average of 132 people died from gun violence—one death every 11 minutes. In 2024, there were more than 500 mass shootings, defined as incidents in which 4 or more people are injured or killed. From 2020–2023, the number exceeded 600 annually. Young people go to school wondering where to hide when a shooter enters their classroom. Each gun injury and fatality results in trauma to family members, loved ones, and the community.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H53F9486D301045B2A8AC7274100E9BF1"><enum>(13)</enum><text>According to reports by the Institute of Economics and Peace, which measures the economic impact of violence and conflict to the global economy, the economic impact of violence to the global economy was $16.5 trillion in 2021.

For every dollar spent on violence prevention and peacebuilding, thousands of lives and dollars are saved. The philosophy and techniques of nonviolence and peacebuilding provide tools and techniques that can be applied not only at the levels of individual and community growth, but also within the Federal Government and at national and international levels.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HA7E9B998AC9448D39F7EBA0F84E96D0F"><enum>(15)</enum><text>Peacebuilding is defined by the United Nations as a range of measures targeted to reduce the risk of lapsing or relapsing into conflict by strengthening national capacities at all levels for conflict management and to lay the foundations for sustainable peace and development. Peacebuilding is predicated on research into the root causes of violence in the United States and the world, through promotion and promulgation of effective policies and programs that ameliorate those root causes of violence, and through providing all citizens, organizations, and governmental bodies with opportunities to learn about and practice the essential tools of nonviolent conflict resolution and peacebuilding.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H760AA2A732444A27ADEC828AAC8F1710"><enum>(16)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Peace is a human right and a security issue.
