Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Restoring Trade Fairness Act.

Section 2:
2.Findings; sense of Congress(a)FindingsCongress makes the following findings:(1)The United States grants normal trade relations status to every country in the world except for Belarus, Cuba, North Korea, and the Russian Federation.(2)Merchandise originating from a country that is a beneficiary of normal trade relations status is subject to duties at the rates set forth in column 1 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (in this Act referred to as the HTS).(3)Merchandise originating from a country that is not a beneficiary of normal trade relations status is subject to duties at the rates set forth in column 2 of the HTS.(4)The United States Schedule of Concessions on goods to the World Trade Organization lists rates of duty the United States is expected to extend to all other members of the World Trade Organization.(5)As of the date of the enactment of this Act, the rates of duty under the United States Schedule of Concessions on goods, on a simple average basis, are the lowest among all members of the World Trade Organization, at 3.4 percent. The duty concessions in the United States Schedule of Concessions align with the duties set forth in column 1 of the HTS.(6)The People's Republic of China was granted normal trade relations status in February 1980, pursuant to title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2431 et seq.), making merchandise from the People's Republic of China eligible for the duties set forth in column 1 of the HTS.(7)From 1980 until 2001, the People's Republic of China’s normal trade relations status was subject to compliance with freedom-of-emigration requirements under section 402 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2432) (commonly referred to as the Jackson-Vanik amendment).(8)In 2001, Public Law 106–286 (114 Stat. 880) was passed to make permanent the People's Republic of China’s normal trade relations status.(9)Entries under section 321 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1321) became an avenue of commerce by way of regulation, when in 1994 the Department of the Treasury and the Customs Service issued an interim rule expanding the class of persons deemed eligible to make informal entries under that section, and exempted shipments by those persons from the requirement to file an entry summary. In both litigation challenging the interim rule and comments on the final rule published the following year, customs brokers warned that the Customs Service was abrogating its responsibility to enforce laws, but their warnings were not heeded. (10)In 2018, following an investigation under title III of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2411 et seq.) into the theft of intellectual property by the People's Republic of China, additional duties affecting approximately one-third of exports from the People's Republic of China to the United States were imposed. On January 15, 2020, the United States and the People's Republic of China signed the Economic and Trade Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the People’s Republic Of China, which required structural reforms and other changes to the economic and trade regime of the People's Republic of China. The People's Republic of China, however, did not comply with the agreement.(11)In December 2022, the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission’s 2022 Annual Report asserted as follows: After many years of attempting to engage China and persuade it to abandon its distortive trade practices, it is clear this approach has not been successful. The United States has an opportunity to develop a new strategy based on building resilience against China’s state capitalism and blunting its harmful effects rather than seeking to change it. With the WTO unable to introduce meaningful new rules and procedures, the United States can pursue approaches that advance its own national interests as well as cooperate with like-minded partners.(12)The Commission’s 2022 Annual Report recommended that the Administration prepare a report to assess China’s compliance with the terms and conditions of the 1999 Agreement on Market Access between the People’s Republic of China and the United States of America. The Commission recommended that [i]f the report concludes that China has failed to comply with the provisions agreed to for its accession to the WTO, Congress should consider legislation to immediately suspend China’s Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) treatment.(13)In February 2023, the Office of the United States Trade Representative released a report entitled 2022 Report to Congress on China’s WTO Compliance. In releasing that report, United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai noted, More than 20 years after it acceded to the WTO, China still embraces a state-led economic and trade approach that runs counter to the open, market-oriented principles endorsed by all members of the organization. China’s approach makes it an outlier and continues to cause serious harm to workers and businesses in the United States and around the world.(14)Since the entry of the People's Republic of China into the WTO, the United States has lost tens of thousands of factories, millions of manufacturing jobs, and trillions of dollars of intellectual property. The United States now suffers chronic annual trade deficits that exceed $1,000,000,000,000, primarily driven by the predatory trade practices of the People’s Republic of China.(15)There is no mechanism in the Agreement establishing the World Trade Organization, nor any of the annexed agreements, to suspend or expel a member government that has flouted the principles and norms underpinning the Agreement.(16)The accession of advanced economies governed by autocratic, anti-American governments to the World Trade Organization has enriched those governments while destabilizing international relations.(17)The ability of the United States to act in concert with allies and partners to strengthen resilient supply chains free of reliance on or interference from adversarial, autocratic governments is hampered by the United States Schedule of Concessions on goods as currently expressed.(b)Sense of CongressIt is the sense of Congress that—(1)continued treatment of the People's Republic of China as a beneficiary of normal trade relations status poses an unacceptable threat to national security and undermines efforts to promote resilient supply chains and economic integration with allies of the United States; and(2)the United States Schedule of Concessions on goods to the World Trade Organization should be modified to accommodate the duty rates set forth in column 2 of the HTS, so that the United States may deny normal trade relations status to another member of the World Trade Organization as warranted without breaching the duty concessions enumerated in the United States Schedule of Concessions.

I119th CONGRESS1st SessionH. R. 694IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESJanuary 23, 2025Mr. Moolenaar (for himself and Mr. Suozzi) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on Ways and Means, and in addition to the Committees on Agriculture, Armed Services, Transportation and Infrastructure, and Energy and Commerce, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concernedA BILLTo suspend normal trade relations with the People’s Republic of China and to increase the rates of duty applicable with respect to articles imported from the People’s Republic of China, and for other purposes.1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Restoring Trade Fairness Act.2.Findings; sense of Congress(a)FindingsCongress makes the following findings:(1)The United States grants normal trade relations status to every country in the world except for Belarus, Cuba, North Korea, and the Russian Federation.(2)Merchandise originating from a country that is a beneficiary of normal trade relations status is subject to duties at the rates set forth in column 1 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (in this Act referred to as the HTS).(3)Merchandise originating from a country that is not a beneficiary of normal trade relations status is subject to duties at the rates set forth in column 2 of the HTS.(4)The United States Schedule of Concessions on goods to the World Trade Organization lists rates of duty the United States is expected to extend to all other members of the World Trade Organization.(5)As of the date of the enactment of this Act, the rates of duty under the United States Schedule of Concessions on goods, on a simple average basis, are the lowest among all members of the World Trade Organization, at 3.4 percent. The duty concessions in the United States Schedule of Concessions align with the duties set forth in column 1 of the HTS.(6)The People's Republic of China was granted normal trade relations status in February 1980, pursuant to title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2431 et seq.), making merchandise from the People's Republic of China eligible for the duties set forth in column 1 of the HTS.(7)From 1980 until 2001, the People's Republic of China’s normal trade relations status was subject to compliance with freedom-of-emigration requirements under section 402 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2432) (commonly referred to as the Jackson-Vanik amendment).(8)In 2001, Public Law 106–286 (114 Stat. 880) was passed to make permanent the People's Republic of China’s normal trade relations status.(9)Entries under section 321 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1321) became an avenue of commerce by way of regulation, when in 1994 the Department of the Treasury and the Customs Service issued an interim rule expanding the class of persons deemed eligible to make informal entries under that section, and exempted shipments by those persons from the requirement to file an entry summary. In both litigation challenging the interim rule and comments on the final rule published the following year, customs brokers warned that the Customs Service was abrogating its responsibility to enforce laws, but their warnings were not heeded. (10)In 2018, following an investigation under title III of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2411 et seq.) into the theft of intellectual property by the People's Republic of China, additional duties affecting approximately one-third of exports from the People's Republic of China to the United States were imposed. On January 15, 2020, the United States and the People's Republic of China signed the Economic and Trade Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the People’s Republic Of China, which required structural reforms and other changes to the economic and trade regime of the People's Republic of China. The People's Republic of China, however, did not comply with the agreement.(11)In December 2022, the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission’s 2022 Annual Report asserted as follows: After many years of attempting to engage China and persuade it to abandon its distortive trade practices, it is clear this approach has not been successful. The United States has an opportunity to develop a new strategy based on building resilience against China’s state capitalism and blunting its harmful effects rather than seeking to change it. With the WTO unable to introduce meaningful new rules and procedures, the United States can pursue approaches that advance its own national interests as well as cooperate with like-minded partners.(12)The Commission’s 2022 Annual Report recommended that the Administration prepare a report to assess China’s compliance with the terms and conditions of the 1999 Agreement on Market Access between the People’s Republic of China and the United States of America. The Commission recommended that [i]f the report concludes that China has failed to comply with the provisions agreed to for its accession to the WTO, Congress should consider legislation to immediately suspend China’s Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) treatment.(13)In February 2023, the Office of the United States Trade Representative released a report entitled 2022 Report to Congress on China’s WTO Compliance. In releasing that report, United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai noted, More than 20 years after it acceded to the WTO, China still embraces a state-led economic and trade approach that runs counter to the open, market-oriented principles endorsed by all members of the organization. China’s approach makes it an outlier and continues to cause serious harm to workers and businesses in the United States and around the world.(14)Since the entry of the People's Republic of China into the WTO, the United States has lost tens of thousands of factories, millions of manufacturing jobs, and trillions of dollars of intellectual property. The United States now suffers chronic annual trade deficits that exceed $1,000,000,000,000, primarily driven by the predatory trade practices of the People’s Republic of China.(15)There is no mechanism in the Agreement establishing the World Trade Organization, nor any of the annexed agreements, to suspend or expel a member government that has flouted the principles and norms underpinning the Agreement.(16)The accession of advanced economies governed by autocratic, anti-American governments to the World Trade Organization has enriched those governments while destabilizing international relations.(17)The ability of the United States to act in concert with allies and partners to strengthen resilient supply chains free of reliance on or interference from adversarial, autocratic governments is hampered by the United States Schedule of Concessions on goods as currently expressed.(b)Sense of CongressIt is the sense of Congress that—(1)continued treatment of the People's Republic of China as a beneficiary of normal trade relations status poses an unacceptable threat to national security and undermines efforts to promote resilient supply chains and economic integration with allies of the United States; and(2)the United States Schedule of Concessions on goods to the World Trade Organization should be modified to accommodate the duty rates set forth in column 2 of the HTS, so that the United States may deny normal trade relations status to another member of the World Trade Organization as warranted without breaching the duty concessions enumerated in the United States Schedule of Concessions.3.Suspension of normal trade relations with the People’s Republic of ChinaNotwithstanding the provisions of title I of Public Law 106–286 (114 Stat. 880) or any other provision of law, beginning on the day after the date of the enactment of this Act, normal trade relations treatment shall not apply pursuant to section 101(a) of that Act to the products of the People’s Republic of China.4.Modifications to rates of duty to address trade with the People's Republic of China(a)Establishment of rates of duty with respect to articles of the People’s Republic of China(1)In generalThe President, by proclamation, shall revise the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (in this Act referred to as the HTS) to include rates of duty applicable only with respect to articles of the People’s Republic of China.(2)RatesThe rates of duty proclaimed under paragraph (1) shall be, except as provided by subsection (h), the rates of duty set forth in the column 2 rate of duty column of the HTS on the day before the date of the enactment of this Act, modified as required by subsection (b) and, if applicable, adjusted for inflation under subsection (c).(b)Modifications to rates of duty with respect to articles of the People’s Republic of China(1)Ad valorem duties and free rates of duty(A)In generalA rate of duty set forth in the column 2 rate of duty column of the HTS that is expressed as a percentage, or that is free, shall, except as provided by subparagraph (B) or (C), continue to apply to articles of the People's Republic of China.(B)Minimum rate of 35 percent ad valoremA rate of duty described in subparagraph (A) that is less than 35 percent ad valorem as of the day before the date of the enactment of this Act shall, except as provided by subparagraph (C), be increased to 35 percent ad valorem.(C)Minimum rate of 100 percent for certain articlesIn the case of an article specified in section 10, a rate of duty described in subparagraph (A) that is less than 100 percent ad valorem as of the day before the date of the enactment of this Act shall be increased to 100 percent ad valorem.(2)Specific and compound rates of duty(A)In generalA rate of duty set forth in the column 2 rate of duty column of the HTS that is expressed as a specific or compound rate of duty shall, except as provided by subparagraphs (B) and (C), continue to apply to articles of the People's Republic of China, subject to adjustment for inflation under subsection (c).(B)Minimum rate equivalent to 35 percent ad valoremA rate of duty described in subparagraph (A) that is less than the equivalent of 35 percent ad valorem, after adjustment for inflation under subsection (c), shall be increased to be equivalent to 35 percent ad valorem.(C)Minimum rate equivalent to 100 percent ad valorem for certain articlesIn the case of an article specified in section 10, a rate of duty described in subparagraph (A) that is less than the equivalent of 100 percent ad valorem, after adjustment for inflation under subsection (c), shall be increased to be equivalent to 100 percent ad valorem.

and(II)be set for each calendar year at an amount that is equal to the amount, if any, by which consumption of the article in the United States in the most recent calendar year for which data are available exceeds production of the article in the United States during that calendar year.(ii)Determination of the People's Republic of China as only sourceFor purposes of subparagraph (A)(i)(I), the President shall determine that an article is imported only from the People's Republic of China if official trade statistics of the Department of Commerce for the most recent full calendar year for which data are available for the applicable subheading of any of chapters 1 through 97 of the HTS, as reported on entry summary forms, show that the article is imported only from the People's Republic of China and from no other country.(B)Entry of in-quota articlesNotwithstanding any other provision of this section, an article described in subparagraph (A)(i)(I) that is entered before the applicable tariff-rate quota is reached for the calendar year in which the article is entered shall—(i)during the 3-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, be subject to the rate of duty applicable to the article on the day before such date of enactment;
