R. 2646IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESApril 3, 2025Mr. Moore of North Carolina (for himself, Ms. Ross, and Mr. Harrigan) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on Science, Space, and TechnologyA BILLTo require the evaluation of certain criteria relating to locations for deployment of successor radar systems of the National Weather Service, and for other purposes.1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Radar Gap Elimination Act. 2.Radar Next Program(a)In generalThe Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere, in consultation with the Director of the National Weather Service, shall establish a program to be known as the Radar Next Program (in this section referred to as the program).(b)RequirementsIn carrying out the program, the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere shall carry out the following:(1)Develop performance and coverage requirements for the weather radar network of the United States, including the territories of the United States.(2)Collaborate with the weather enterprise (as such term is defined in section 2 of the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2017 (15 U.S.C. 8501)) to determine potential solutions to update the weather radar network of the United States that meets the requirements developed under paragraph (1).(3)Develop a plan in accordance with subsection (c).(c)Plan(1)In generalThe Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere shall develop a plan to replace the Next Generation Weather Radar of the National Weather Service system in existence as of the date of the enactment of this Act (in this subsection referred to as the NEXRAD system).(2)ElementsThe plan developed under this subsection shall seek to continue and improve weather radar coverage in the United States and its territories, and include the following:(A)Estimates of quantifiable improvements in performance, coverage, and accuracy to be made from potential options for replacement of the NEXRAD system.(B)Development of a proof-of-concept phased array radar to test and determine the specifications and requirements for such replacement.(C)Expected actions needed to implement the recommendations of the report published by the Environmental Information Services Working Group of the Science Advisory Board of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in November 2023 and entitled A NESDIS Observing System Backbone Framework to assist in defining a radar backbone architecture that will best serve the United States.(D)Establishment of a weather surveillance radar testbed for the following:(i)Evaluation of commercial radars with the potential to replace or supplement the NEXRAD system.(ii)Providing technical assistance for the use of small, gap-filling radars with private and local partners in regions where geographical topography prevents the full use of large systems or in locations where such systems may not be commercially viable.(E)Consultation and input solicited from academia, meteorologists, emergency managers, and public safety or utility officials regarding the specifications and requirements for replacement of the NEXRAD system.(F)Prioritized locations for initial deployment of the system that will replace the NEXRAD system.(G)Expected locations of the system that will replace the NEXRAD system, including sites located more than 75 miles away from an existing NEXRAD system station and additional appropriate locations.(H)Expected or planned improvements to data available for weather and water-related forecasts and warnings from the system that will replace the NEXRAD system.(3)Procurement deadlineThe Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere shall take such actions as may be necessary to ensure the plan developed under this subsection is fully implemented and executed by not later than September 30, 2040.(d)Radar-as-a-Service(1)In generalThe Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere may partner or contract with entities outside of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to fill data gaps in weather radar coverage using diverse weather radars and data assimilation technologies in order to accomplish the following:(A)Supplement data gaps in weather radar coverage, including at low levels and wide areas, in existence as of the date of the enactment of this Act.(B)Ensure the continued performance of the United States’ weather radar network.(C)Better detect significant precipitation and severe weather over a greater area across a population.(2)ConsiderationsIn carrying out paragraph (1), the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere may consider the following:(A)Partnering or contracting with entities that have participated in the testbed described in subsection (c)(2)(D), the National Mesonet Program, or Cooperative Research and Development Agreements.(B)Weather camera systems and services, including in
