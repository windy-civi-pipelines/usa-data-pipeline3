<whereas><text>Whereas the International Maritime Organization (IMO), a specialized agency of the United Nations, is expected to vote on a <quote>Net-Zero Framework</quote> proposal that would impose a global tax or levy on maritime shipping emissions;</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas the proposed scheme would require vessels to pay into a centralized international fund based on their carbon emissions, creating an unprecedented global taxation system on trade and transportation;</text></whereas>
