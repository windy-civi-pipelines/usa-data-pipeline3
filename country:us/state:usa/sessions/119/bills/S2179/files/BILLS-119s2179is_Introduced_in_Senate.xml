 <text display-inline="yes-display-inline">In 2017, an M–44 device exposed an Idaho child to a sublethal dose of sodium cyanide with subsequent short-term and long-term medical complications. Two Wyoming children were also exposed to the poison from another M–44 device. Three family dogs died in these two separate incidents. More than 50 family dogs have been documented as killed by M–44 devices since 1990. The full count is estimated to be significantly higher.</text>

 <text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The indiscriminate M–44 device commonly harms nontarget wildlife and people; at least 42 people have accidentally triggered a cyanide bomb causing exposure to cyanide gas and injuries since 1984.
