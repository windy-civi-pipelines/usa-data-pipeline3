        </whereas>
        <whereas>
 <text>Whereas pro-independence politician Isaias Afwerki was chosen by the National Assembly as the country’s first post-independence President, and he has remained in that position since 2013, even though Eritrea has never held a national election;</text>

        </whereas>
        <whereas>
 <text>Whereas, when the Constitution of Eritrea was unanimously approved and ratified in 1997, it included key freedoms, rights to participate <quote>in any position of leadership in the country</quote> and <quote>conditions necessary for developing a democratic political culture</quote>, the <quote>right to vote</quote>, the <quote>guarantee</quote> to actively participate in <quote>all political life</quote>, and the right to a <quote>fair, speedy, and public</quote> trial and <quote>due process</quote> of law;</text>
        </whereas>
        <whereas>
 <text>Whereas, despite ratification, the Constitution was never formally implemented, and since independence, Eritrea has yet to hold a national election, remaining a one-party state ruled by President Isaias Afwerki without a functioning legislature, independent judiciary, or free press;</text>
        </whereas>
        <whereas commented="no">
 <text>Whereas President Afwerki exercises de facto control over legislative functions, including the National Assembly, which has not met since 2002;</text>
        </whereas>

        </whereas>
        <whereas>

        </whereas>
        <whereas>
 <text>Whereas the 2019 UNHCR Global Trends Report ranked Eritrea among the top 10 countries of origin for refugees, with more than 500,000 displaced in part due to political repression and systemic human rights abuses;</text>
        </whereas>
        <whereas>
 <text>Whereas the 2024 Report of the Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in Eritrea mandated by the United Nations Human Rights Council found the human rights situation in Eritrea remains dire, with no signs of institutional or policy reform, as citizens are subjected to indefinite national service, arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance, transnational repression, and a deeply entrenched culture of fear;</text>
        </whereas>
        <whereas>
 <text>Whereas Eritrea’s extensive prison system includes secret and unofficial detention centers where detainees are held indefinitely and often without notification of charges or access to legal representation;</text>

        </whereas>
        <whereas>
 <text>Whereas Eritrea’s national service program was initially mandated to last 18 months, but has become indefinite and compulsory in practice for a significant portion of the population, trapping thousands of youths into years of effectively state-sponsored forced labor;</text>
        </whereas>
