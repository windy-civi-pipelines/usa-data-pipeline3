Section 2:
2.
            Findings
 Congress finds the following:  (1) Biotechnology is routinely used to modify genetic sequences in plants, animals, and microorganisms, resulting in useful products across agriculture, medicine, industry, and defense.

                (a)
                In general
 Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Director of the National Science Foundation (referred to in this section as the Director), in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and heads of other Federal agencies with relevant expertise as determined by the Director, shall enter into an agreement with the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (referred to in this section as the National Academies)—
                
                    (1)
 to conduct a 2-phase study, in accordance with subsections (b) and (c), on the safety and benefits of biotechnology; and
                
                
                    (2)
 to submit reports describing the results of the studies and including findings and recommendations, in accordance with subsection (d).
                
            
            
                (b)
                Phase one of study
 Not later than 1 year after the date on which the agreement described in subsection (a) is entered into, the National Academies shall complete phase one of the study, which shall, at a minimum—
                
                    (1)
 consider the characteristics and risks of biotechnology tools used to modify genetic sequences in comparison to the characteristics and risks of comparable conventional methods used to modify genetic sequences;
                
                
                    (2)
 make recommendations about risk-proportionate frameworks to assess risks of products made with biotechnology tools; and
                
                
                    (3)
 identify research needed to further understand the safety of biotechnology tools.
                
            
            
                (c)
                Phase two of study
 Not later than 2 years after the date on which the agreement described in subsection (a) is entered into, the National Academies shall complete phase two of the study, which shall, at a minimum—
                
                    (1)
 consider the safety and benefits of commercialized biotechnology products alongside comparable conventional products and other human activities that may impact human health or the environment;
                
                
                    (2)
 make recommendations about evaluating the safety and potential benefits of future biotechnology products that are under development or not yet widely commercialized;
                
                
                    (3)
 make recommendations about processes, analysis, or tests that could be used to rapidly reduce or remove biotechnology-specific oversight of products that do not present a greater risk than comparable conventional products or other human activities; and
                
                
                    (4)
 identify research needed to further understand safety or benefits of biotechnology products.
                
            
            
                (d)
