Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Competition and Antitrust Law Enforcement Reform Act of 2025.

Section 2:
2.Findings and purposes(a)FindingsCongress finds that—(1)competitive markets, in which multiple firms compete to buy and sell products and services, are critical to ensuring economic opportunity for all people in the United States and providing resilience to the economy during unpredictable times;(2)when companies compete, businesses offer the highest quality and choice of goods and services for the lowest possible prices to consumers and other businesses;(3)competition fosters small business growth, reduces economic inequality, and spurs innovation and job creation;(4)competitive markets are crucial for the United States global economic competitiveness and national security;(5)in the United States economy today, the presence and exercise of market power is substantial and growing;(6)the presence and exercise of market power makes it more difficult for people in the United States to start their own businesses, depresses wages, and increases economic inequality, with particularly damaging effects on historically disadvantaged communities;(7)market power and undue market concentration contribute to the consolidation of political power, undermining the health of democracy in the United States;(8)the anticompetitive effects of monopoly power or buyer market power include higher prices, lower quality, lessened choice, reduced innovation, foreclosure of competitors, and increased entry barriers;(9)monopsony power or seller market power allows a firm to force suppliers of goods or services to accept below market prices or to force workers to accept below market wages, resulting in lower quality products and services, reduced opportunities for suppliers and workers, reduced availability of products and services for consumers, reduced innovation, foreclosure of competitors, and increased entry barriers;(10)horizontal consolidation, vertical consolidation, and conglomerate mergers all have the potential to increase market power and cause anticompetitive harm;(11)extensive consolidation is reducing competition and threatens to place the American dream further out of reach for many consumers in the United States;(12)since 2008, firms in the United States have engaged in over $10,000,000,000,000 in mergers and acquisitions;(13)the acquisition of nascent or potential rivals by dominant firms can present significant long-term threats to competition and innovation and harm the global economic competitiveness of the United States;(14)the acquisition, by one of its competitors, of a maverick firm that plays a disruptive role in the market, by using an innovative business model or technology, offering lower prices or new, different products or services, or by other means that benefit consumers, often presents a threat to competition;(15)section 7 of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 18) is the primary line of defense against anticompetitive mergers;(16)in recent years, some court decisions and enforcement policies have limited the vitality of the Clayton Act to prevent harmful consolidation by—(A)discounting previously accepted presumptions that certain acquisitions are anticompetitive;(B)focusing inordinately on the effect of an acquisition on price in the short term, to the exclusion of other potential anticompetitive effects;(C)underestimating the dangers that horizontal, vertical, and conglomerate mergers will lower quality, reduce choice, impede innovation, exclude competitors, increase entry barriers, or create buyer power, including monopsony power;(D)failing to properly account for direct evidence of competitive harm, including intent evidence; and(E)requiring the government to prove harmful effects of a proposed merger to a near certainty;(17)anticompetitive exclusionary conduct constitutes a particularly harmful exercise of market power and a substantial threat to the United States economy;(18)when dominant sellers exercise market power, they harm buyers by overcharging them, reducing product or service quality, limiting their choices, and impairing innovation;(19)when dominant buyers exercise market power, they harm suppliers by underpaying them, limiting their business opportunities, and impairing innovation;(20)when dominant employers exercise market power, they harm workers by paying them low wages, reducing their benefits, and limiting their future employment opportunities;(21)nascent or potential rivals, even those that are unprofitable or inefficient, are an important source of competitive discipline for dominant firms;(22)antitrust enforcement against anticompetitive exclusionary conduct has been impeded when courts have declined to rigorously examine the facts in favor of relying on inaccurate economic assumptions that are inconsistent with contemporary economic learning, such as presuming that market power is not durable and can be expected to self-correct, that monopolies can drive as much or more innovation than a competitive market, that above-cost pricing cannot harm competition, and other flawed assumptions;(23)the courts of the United States have improperly implied immunity from the antitrust laws based on Federal regulatory statutes, even limiting the application of statutory antitrust savings clauses passed by Congress;(24)the civil remedies currently available to cure violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act, including injunctions, equitable monetary relief, and private damages, have not proven sufficient, on their own, to deter anticompetitive conduct;(25)in some cases, effective deterrence requires the imposition of civil penalties, alone or in combination with existing remedies, including structural relief, behavioral relief, private damages, and equitable monetary relief, including disgorgement and restitution; and(26)Federal antitrust enforcement budgets have failed to keep pace with the growth of the economy and increasing demands on agency resources, significantly undermining the ability of the Federal antitrust agencies to fulfill their law enforcement missions and contributing to the rise of market power in the American economy.(b)PurposesThe purposes of this Act are to—(1)enhance competition throughout the American economy by strengthening antitrust enforcement by the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, the State enforcement agencies, and private parties;(2)revise the legal standard under section 7 of the Clayton Act to better enable enforcers to arrest the likely anticompetitive effects of harmful mergers in their incipiency, as Congress intended, by clarifying that the potential effects that may justify prohibiting a merger under the Clayton Act include lower quality, reduced choice, reduced innovation, the exclusion of competitors, or increased entry barriers, in addition to increased price to buyers or reduced price to sellers;(3)amend the Clayton Act to clarify that an acquisition that tends to create a monopsony violates the Clayton Act;(4)establish simple, cost-effective decision rules that require the parties to certain acquisitions that either significantly increase concentration or are extremely large bear the burden of establishing that the acquisition will not materially harm competition;(5)prohibit and deter exclusionary conduct that harms competition, particularly by dominant firms;(6)enable the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission to seek civil monetary penalties, in addition to existing remedies, for violations of the Sherman Act;(7)give the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission additional financial resources and enforcement tools to craft remedies for individual violations that are effective to deter future unlawful conduct and proportionate to the gravity of the violation;(8)provide further protections for those who provide evidence of anticompetitive conduct to government enforcers and potential financial rewards for whistleblowers who provide information to the government that leads to a criminal fine; and(9)grant successful antitrust plaintiffs the right to obtain prejudgment interest on damages awards to further deter anticompetitive conduct and increase compensation to injured parties.

II119th CONGRESS1st SessionS. 130IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATESJanuary 16, 2025Ms. Klobuchar (for herself, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Booker, Ms. Hirono, Mr. Welch, Mr. Heinrich, Mr. Markey, Mr. Murphy, Ms. Smith, Mr. Schatz, Mr. Warner, Mr. Wyden, and Mr. Bennet) introduced the following bill; which was read twice and referred to the Committee on the JudiciaryA BILLTo reform the antitrust laws to better protect competition in the American economy, to amend the Clayton Act to modify the standard for an unlawful acquisition, to deter anticompetitive exclusionary conduct that harms competition and consumers, to enhance the ability of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission to enforce the antitrust laws, and for other purposes.1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Competition and Antitrust Law Enforcement Reform Act of 2025.2.Findings and purposes(a)FindingsCongress finds that—(1)competitive markets, in which multiple firms compete to buy and sell products and services, are critical to ensuring economic opportunity for all people in the United States and providing resilience to the economy during unpredictable times;(2)when companies compete, businesses offer the highest quality and choice of goods and services for the lowest possible prices to consumers and other businesses;(3)competition fosters small business growth, reduces economic inequality, and spurs innovation and job creation;(4)competitive markets are crucial for the United States global economic competitiveness and national security;(5)in the United States economy today, the presence and exercise of market power is substantial and growing;(6)the presence and exercise of market power makes it more difficult for people in the United States to start their own businesses, depresses wages, and increases economic inequality, with particularly damaging effects on historically disadvantaged communities;(7)market power and undue market concentration contribute to the consolidation of political power, undermining the health of democracy in the United States;(8)the anticompetitive effects of monopoly power or buyer market power include higher prices, lower quality, lessened choice, reduced innovation, foreclosure of competitors, and increased entry barriers;(9)monopsony power or seller market power allows a firm to force suppliers of goods or services to accept below market prices or to force workers to accept below market wages, resulting in lower quality products and services, reduced opportunities for suppliers and workers, reduced availability of products and services for consumers, reduced innovation, foreclosure of competitors, and increased entry barriers;(10)horizontal consolidation, vertical consolidation, and conglomerate mergers all have the potential to increase market power and cause anticompetitive harm;(11)extensive consolidation is reducing competition and threatens to place the American dream further out of reach for many consumers in the United States;(12)since 2008, firms in the United States have engaged in over $10,000,000,000,000 in mergers and acquisitions;(13)the acquisition of nascent or potential rivals by dominant firms can present significant long-term threats to competition and innovation and harm the global economic competitiveness of the United States;(14)the acquisition, by one of its competitors, of a maverick firm that plays a disruptive role in the market, by using an innovative business model or technology, offering lower prices or new, different products or services, or by other means that benefit consumers, often presents a threat to competition;(15)section 7 of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 18) is the primary line of defense against anticompetitive mergers;(16)in recent years, some court decisions and enforcement policies have limited the vitality of the Clayton Act to prevent harmful consolidation by—(A)discounting previously accepted presumptions that certain acquisitions are anticompetitive;(B)focusing inordinately on the effect of an acquisition on price in the short term, to the exclusion of other potential anticompetitive effects;(C)underestimating the dangers that horizontal, vertical, and conglomerate mergers will lower quality, reduce choice, impede innovation, exclude competitors, increase entry barriers, or create buyer power, including monopsony power;(D)failing to properly account for direct evidence of competitive harm, including intent evidence; and(E)requiring the government to prove harmful effects of a proposed merger to a near certainty;(17)anticompetitive exclusionary conduct constitutes a particularly harmful exercise of market power and a substantial threat to the United States economy;(18)when dominant sellers exercise market power, they harm buyers by overcharging them, reducing product or service quality, limiting their choices, and impairing innovation;(19)when dominant buyers exercise market power, they harm suppliers by underpaying them, limiting their business opportunities, and impairing innovation;(20)when dominant employers exercise market power, they harm workers by paying them low wages, reducing their benefits, and limiting their future employment opportunities;(21)nascent or potential rivals, even those that are unprofitable or inefficient, are an important source of competitive discipline for dominant firms;(22)antitrust enforcement against anticompetitive exclusionary conduct has been impeded when courts have declined to rigorously examine the facts in favor of relying on inaccurate economic assumptions that are inconsistent with contemporary economic learning, such as presuming that market power is not durable and can be expected to self-correct, that monopolies can drive as much or more innovation than a competitive market, that above-cost pricing cannot harm competition, and other flawed assumptions;(23)the courts of the United States have improperly implied immunity from the antitrust laws based on Federal regulatory statutes, even limiting the application of statutory antitrust savings clauses passed by Congress;(24)the civil remedies currently available to cure violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act, including injunctions, equitable monetary relief, and private damages, have not proven sufficient, on their own, to deter anticompetitive conduct;(25)in some cases, effective deterrence requires the imposition of civil penalties, alone or in combination with existing remedies, including structural relief, behavioral relief, private damages, and equitable monetary relief, including disgorgement and restitution; and(26)Federal antitrust enforcement budgets have failed to keep pace with the growth of the economy and increasing demands on agency resources, significantly undermining the ability of the Federal antitrust agencies to fulfill their law enforcement missions and contributing to the rise of market power in the American economy.(b)PurposesThe purposes of this Act are to—(1)enhance competition throughout the American economy by strengthening antitrust enforcement by the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, the State enforcement agencies, and private parties;(2)revise the legal standard under section 7 of the Clayton Act to better enable enforcers to arrest the likely anticompetitive effects of harmful mergers in their incipiency, as Congress intended, by clarifying that the potential effects that may justify prohibiting a merger under the Clayton Act include lower quality, reduced choice, reduced innovation, the exclusion of competitors, or increased entry barriers, in addition to increased price to buyers or reduced price to sellers;(3)amend the Clayton Act to clarify that an acquisition that tends to create a monopsony violates the Clayton Act;(4)establish simple, cost-effective decision rules that require the parties to certain acquisitions that either significantly increase concentration or are extremely large bear the burden of establishing that the acquisition will not materially harm competition;(5)prohibit and deter exclusionary conduct that harms competition, particularly by dominant firms;(6)enable the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission to seek civil monetary penalties, in addition to existing remedies, for violations of the Sherman Act;(7)give the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission additional financial resources and enforcement tools to craft remedies for individual violations that are effective to deter future unlawful conduct and proportionate to the gravity of the violation;(8)provide further protections for those who provide evidence of anticompetitive conduct to government enforcers and potential financial rewards for whistleblowers who provide information to the government that leads to a criminal fine; and(9)grant successful antitrust plaintiffs the right to obtain prejudgment interest on damages awards to further deter anticompetitive conduct and increase compensation to injured parties.3.DefinitionIn this Act the term antitrust laws—(1)has the meaning given the term in the first section of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12); and(2)includes—(A)section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45) to the extent that such section applies to unfair methods of competition; and(B)this Act and the amendments made by this Act.4.Unlawful acquisitions(a)Market powerSubsection (a) of the first section of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12) is amended by adding at the end the following:The term market power in this Act means the ability of a person, or a group of persons acting in concert, to profitably impose terms or conditions on counterparties, including terms regarding price, quantity, product or service quality, or other terms affecting the value of consideration exchanged in the transaction, that are more favorable to the person or group of persons imposing them than what the person or group of persons could obtain in a competitive market..(b)Unlawful acquisitionsSection 7 of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 18) is amended—(1)in the first and second undesignated paragraphs, by striking substantially to lessen each place that term appears and inserting to create an appreciable risk of materially lessening;(2)by inserting or a monopsony after monopoly each place that term appears;

or(ii)tends to foreclose or limit the ability or incentive of 1 or more actual or potential competitors to compete.(B)Limitations(i)In generalApplying for or enforcing a patent, trademark, or copyright, unless such applications or enforcement actions are baseless or made in bad faith or in violation of a legal obligation, shall not alone constitute exclusionary conduct, but such actions may be considered as part of a course of conduct that constitutes exclusionary conduct.(ii)ConductConduct that is necessary to comply with Federal or State law shall not alone constitute exclusionary conduct, but such actions may be considered as part of a course of conduct that constitutes exclusionary conduct.(2)Market powerThe term market power means the ability of a person, or a group of persons acting in concert, to profitably impose terms or conditions on counterparties, including terms regarding price, quantity, product or service quality, or other terms affecting the value of consideration exchanged in the transaction, that are more favorable to the person or group of persons imposing them than what the person or group of persons could obtain in a competitive market.(b)Violation(1)In generalIt shall be unlawful for a person, acting alone or in concert with other persons, to engage in exclusionary conduct that presents an appreciable risk of harming competition.(2)Unfair method of competitionA violation of paragraph (1) shall also constitute an unfair method of competition under section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45).(c)Presumption(1)In generalExcept as provided in paragraph (2), exclusionary conduct shall be presumed to present an appreciable risk of harming competition and shall be a violation of subsection (b)(1) if the exclusionary conduct is undertaken, with respect to a relevant market, by a person or by a group of more than 1 person acting in concert that—(A)has a market share of greater than 50 percent as a seller or a buyer in the relevant market; or(B)otherwise has significant market power in the relevant market.(2)ExceptionParagraph (1) shall not apply if the defendant establishes, by a preponderance of the evidence, that—(A)distinct procompetitive benefits of the exclusionary conduct in the relevant market eliminate the risk of harming competition presented by the exclusionary conduct;(B)1 or more persons, not including any person participating in or facilitating the exclusionary conduct, have entered or expanded their presence in the market with the effect of eliminating the risk of harming competition posed by the exclusionary conduct;
