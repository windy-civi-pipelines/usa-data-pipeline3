                (a)
                Finding
 Congress finds that section 1003 of the Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1985 (Public Law 98–525; 63 Stat. 2241)—
                
                    (1)
 expresses the sense of Congress that, due to threats that are ever-changing, Congress must be informed with respect to allied contributions to the common defense to properly assess the readiness of the United States and the countries described in subsection (c)(2) for threats; and
                
                
                    (2)
 requires the Secretary of Defense to submit to Congress an annual report on the contributions of allies to the common defense.

                    (2)
 the United States should not continue to shoulder a disproportionate share of the burden for European security while current and prospective members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization neglect to meet defense spending guidelines; and
                
                
                    (3)
 the President should seek from each member country of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization acceptance of international security responsibilities and agreements to make contributions to the common defense in accordance with the collective defense treaty to which such country is a party.
