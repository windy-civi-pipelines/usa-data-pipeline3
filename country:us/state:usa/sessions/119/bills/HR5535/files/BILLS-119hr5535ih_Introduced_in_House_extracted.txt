(b)Waiver  (1) Authority In the case of a noncitizen veteran described in subsection (a), the Secretary of Homeland Security may waive any applicable ground of inadmissibility under section 212(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)) (other than paragraphs (3) and (2)(H) of such section 212(a)), a finding of inadmissibility under paragraph (2)(A) based on a conviction of an aggravated felony described in subparagraph (A), (I), or (K) of section 101(a)(43) (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(43)), or 5 convictions for driving while intoxicated (including a conviction for driving while under the influence of or imparied by alcohol or drugs) unless the conviction is older than 25 years, if the Secretary determines that it is in the public interest.
                 
(2)Public interest considerationsIn determining whether a waiver described in paragraph (1) is in the public interest, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall consider factors including the noncitizen’s service in the Armed Forces, and the recency and severity of any offense or conduct that forms the basis of a finding of inadmissibility under section 212(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)). (c)ProceduresNot later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, by rule, establish procedures to carry out this section.

(e)ClarificationIf a noncitizen veteran’s status is adjusted under this section to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, or if such noncitizen is lawfully admitted for permanent residence, such adjustment or admission shall create a presumption that the noncitizen has established good moral character under paragraphs (1) through (8) of section 101(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(f)). 
(f)Limitation on removal 
(1)In generalA noncitizen who appears to be prima facie eligible for lawful permanent resident status under this section shall be given a reasonable opportunity to apply for such status. Such noncitizen shall not be removed from the United States until a final administrative decision establishing ineligibility for such status is rendered. (2)Effect of final orderA noncitizen present in the United States who has been ordered removed or has been permitted to depart voluntarily from the United States may, notwithstanding such order or permission to depart, apply for lawful permanent resident status under this section. Such noncitizen shall not be required to file a separate motion to reopen, reconsider, or vacate the order of removal. If the Secretary of Homeland Security approves the application, the Secretary shall notify the Attorney General of such approval, and the Attorney General shall cancel the order of removal. If the Secretary renders a final administrative decision to deny the application, the order of removal or permission to depart shall be effective and enforceable to the same extent as if the application had not been made, only after all available administrative and judicial remedies have been exhausted.
