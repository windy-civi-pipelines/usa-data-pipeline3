(II)DefinitionFor purposes of this clause, an eligibility date means— (aa)in the case of an individual who is not receiving medical assistance when the individual applies for an insurance affordability program (as defined in section 2 of the Easy Enrollment in Health Care Act), whether such application takes place through section 3(b) of such Act or otherwise, the date on which such individual applies for such program; and
