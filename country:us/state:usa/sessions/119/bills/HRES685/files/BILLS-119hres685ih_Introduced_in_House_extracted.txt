IV119th CONGRESS1st SessionH. RES. 685IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESSeptember 9, 2025Mrs. Cammack (for herself, Ms. Kamlager-Dove, Mrs. Kim, Ms. Pettersen, Mrs. Hinson, Ms. Adams, Mrs. Cherfilus-McCormick, and Mr. Landsman) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and CommerceRESOLUTIONExpressing support for testing for antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) as a standard part of prenatal screening, and for other purposes. 
Whereas antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a condition in which the immune system of an individual mistakenly produces antibodies that increase the risk of blood clots; Whereas APS can increase the risk of miscarriages, stillbirths, and pregnancy complications; 
Whereas professional medical associations and guideline-setting bodies do not recommend testing for APS as a standard part of prenatal screening; Whereas professional medical associations and guideline-setting bodies recommend testing for APS only if a woman has an unexplained fetal loss after 10 weeks or 3 or more unexplained embryonic losses (miscarriages); 
Whereas APS is responsible for about 15 percent of recurrent pregnancy losses; Whereas the total number of miscarriages caused by APS is unknown because it is not tested as part of normal prenatal screening; 
Whereas APS can be detected by a blood test and treated by blood thinners; and Whereas testing for APS during normal prenatal screening can save babies and reduce grief for women and families: Now, therefore, be it 
That the House of Representatives— (1)supports testing for antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) as a standard part of prenatal screening; and 
(2)calls upon professional medical associations and guideline-setting bodies to update their recommendations to include testing for APS as a standard part of prenatal screening.
