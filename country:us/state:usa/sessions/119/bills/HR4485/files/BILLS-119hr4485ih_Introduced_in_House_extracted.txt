Section 1:
1.Short title
 This Act may be cited as the Climate-Friendly Food Label Task Force Act.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following: (1)10 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions emitted by the United States come from the agricultural sector. 
(2)Sustainable agricultural practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prevent deforestation will be critical to preventing the Earth from reaching 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial levels, the threshold that would result in catastrophic climate-related effects. (3)Improving the agricultural sector’s impact on the climate is a vital component of efforts by the U.S. to meet its contributions to the Paris Agreement. 
(4)The USDA Organic label represents a successful model for using a voluntary, market-based approaches to driving innovation in the agricultural sector and successfully created a robust organic market in the United States. (5)Market-based approaches like USDA Organic can spark significant economic benefits including jobs, and new, higher revenues for farmers. 
(6)In 2021, organic farming totaled $11,200,000,000 in sales, created opportunity for 17,445 organic farms, and 28 percent of organic farmers planned to continue to grow their level or organic production. A similar voluntary, market-based approach to climate-friendly agricultural practices could create comparable economic benefits for farmers and workers.

Section 3:

(b)MembersThe advisory panel established under subsection (a) shall be composed of members appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture and shall include— (1)representatives—

            (B)
 uses market-based approaches that allows for greater consumer choice and education; and
           
(2)how such a certification would measure— (A)the life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions of agricultural products;
