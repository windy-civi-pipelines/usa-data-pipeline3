Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Taiwan Undersea Cable Resilience Initiative Act.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following:(1)Undersea communication cables (in this Act referred to as undersea cables) are critical infrastructure essential for global communication, commerce, and national security, particularly for Taiwan, whose economic and security stability relies heavily on undersea cable connectivity.(2)The Government of the People's Republic of China has increasingly used gray zone tactics to undermine the security and sovereignty of Taiwan, including suspected sabotage of undersea cables in and around Taiwan, such as the incidents involving the severing of cables around the Matsu Islands of Taiwan and other key regions in 2023 and 2025.(3)Undersea cables are a primary target in the strategy of the Government of the People's Republic of China to cripple the communication capabilities of Taiwan in the event of a military conflict, as part of broader hybrid warfare tactics. Disruption of undersea cables would significantly impact the ability of Taiwan to communicate both domestically and internationally, leading to a breakdown in military, economic, and social functions.(4)The vulnerability of Taiwan to attacks on undersea cables has been compounded by an increasing number of foreign vessels suspected of involvement in sabotage, including Chinese-linked vessels, which are perceived as direct threats to Taiwan's critical infrastructure.(5)The ability of the Government of the People's Republic of China to disrupt or sever undersea cables is a critical element of its military strategy aimed at softening Taiwan's defenses and isolating Taiwan from international support in the event of an invasion or military confrontation.(6)Recent activities by foreign adversaries, particularly the People's Republic of China, have increased the risk of sabotage and disruption to undersea cables serving Taiwan and other nations. Notably, in February 2023, the Matsu Islands of Taiwan experienced major internet disruptions due to two undersea cables being severed, with suspicions pointing toward deliberate external interference. Furthermore, in January 2025, Chunghwa Telecom reported damage to an international undersea cable and identified a suspicious vessel—the Chinese-linked cargo ship Shunxin39—near the affected area. The Coast Guard of Taiwan has indicated concerns that that vessel may have been involved in deliberately cutting the cable. In a subsequent incident, Taiwan seized the Togo-flagged Hong Tai 58, suspected of deliberately severing an undersea cable. The Coast Guard of Taiwan acknowledged the possibility of China's involvement as part of a grey area intrusion.(7)Since 2023, there have been at least 11 cases of damage to undersea cables around Taiwan and a similar number in the Baltic Sea, with authorities in Taiwan and Europe suspecting Chinese and Russian involvement in several incidents, although some damages have been attributed to natural causes. Those incidents highlight the vulnerability of those critical systems to gray zone tactics and the difficulty of proving sabotage or holding perpetrators accountable.(8)The sabotage of undersea cables constitutes gray zone tactics designed to destabilize and undermine international security without direct military confrontation.(9)Several regional mechanisms have been established to bolster the security of undersea cables, including the Nordic Warden initiative for maritime domain awareness and the Quad Partnership for Cable Connectivity and Resilience, aimed at enhancing the security and resilience of undersea cables in the Indo-Pacific.(10)To counter the threats described in this section and safeguard the resilience of Taiwan, it is imperative for the United States and its allies to take decisive action to bolster Taiwan's defenses for undersea cables and foster international cooperation to protect those critical assets.

Section 3:
3.Taiwan Undersea Cable Resilience Initiative(a)EstablishmentNot later than 360 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State, in coordination with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Commandant of the Coast Guard, and such other heads of agencies as the Secretary of State considers relevant, shall establish an initiative to be known as the Taiwan Undersea Cable Resilience Initiative (in this section referred to as the Initiative).(b)PriorityThe Initiative shall prioritize the protection and resilience of undersea cables near Taiwan, with a focus on countering threats from the People's Republic of China to the critical infrastructure of Taiwan.(c)Key focus areas(1)Advanced monitoring and detection capabilitiesIn carrying out the Initiative, the Secretary of State, in coordination with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of Defense, shall develop and deploy advanced undersea cable monitoring systems for Taiwan capable of detecting disruptions or potential sabotage in real-time, including by informing Taiwan, as appropriate, of early warnings from global intelligence networks.(2)Rapid response protocolsIn carrying out the Initiative, the Secretary of State shall—(A)establish rapid response protocols for repairing severed undersea cables or mitigating disruptions; and(B)work with allies of the United States to help Taiwan develop the logistical capacity to respond quickly to attacks on undersea cables and minimize downtime.(3)Enhancing maritime domain awarenessIn carrying out the Initiative—(A)the Secretary of the Navy and the Commandant of the Coast Guard, in collaboration with the Coast Guard of Taiwan and regional allies, shall enhance maritime domain awareness around Taiwan, focusing on the detection of suspicious vessels or activities near critical undersea cable routes; and(B)the Commandant of the Coast Guard shall assist in joint patrols and surveillance, particularly in the Taiwan Strait and surrounding maritime zones, to monitor potential threats and prevent sabotage.(4)International frameworks for protection(A)In generalIn carrying out the Initiative, the Secretary of State shall seek to establish cooperative frameworks with regional allies and global partners to protect the undersea cable networks near Taiwan.(B)ElementsThe frameworks established under subparagraph (A) shall provide for participation by the United States in joint drills, intelligence-sharing platforms, and collaborative surveillance operations to enhance collective security against sabotage.(5)Taiwan-specific cable hardeningIn carrying out the Initiative, the Secretary of State shall encourage and support the hardening of critical undersea cables near Taiwan, including reinforcing cables, improving burial depths, and using more resilient materials to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and deliberate interference.

Section 4:
4.Countering China’s gray zone tactics (a) Working with partners To counter Chinese sabotage The President shall work with Taiwan and like-minded international partners to implement strategies that directly counter the use by the Government of the People's Republic of China of undersea cable sabotage as part of its gray zone warfare, including by increasing diplomatic pressure on that Government to adhere to international norms regarding the protection of undersea infrastructure.
 (b)Raising awarenessThe President shall work with Taiwan to raise global awareness of the risks posed by interference by the Government of the People's Republic of China in undersea cables, including through public diplomacy efforts, information sharing, and international forums that address gray zone tactics and the protection of critical infrastructure.
