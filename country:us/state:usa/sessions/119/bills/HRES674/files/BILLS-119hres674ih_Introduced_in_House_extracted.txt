119th CONGRESS 
1st Session 
H. RES. 674 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
 
September 3, 2025 
Mr. Carter of Georgia submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Ethics 
 
RESOLUTION 
Censuring Representative Rashida Tlaib for promoting and cheering on terrorism and antisemitism at the People’s Conference for Palestine. 
 
 
Whereas Representative Rashida Tlaib cheered on one of the most radical and antisemitic conferences in America—the People’s Conference for Palestine;  Whereas, at the People’s Conference for Palestine, Aisha Nizar, a leader with the Palestinian Youth Movement, urged the audience to undermine and sabotage the United States military and defense readiness by disrupting the F–35 supply chain logistics;
                 

 Whereas Aisha Nizar stated, 70% of the cost of the F–35 program actually comes from the supply chain… It functions off of this just-in-time logistics process… If one specific node of the F–35 supply chain is intervened in, it has a huge impact… We need to be surgical. We need to be strategic. And we need to be bold in our actions. Because there are many different points of these supply chains of death that we can intervene in—and we must intervene in;
                 

 Whereas the People’s Conference for Palestine laid out a militant strategy to not only attack weapons manufacturers but also target logistics companies to undermine the United States military supply chains;
                 
Whereas openly calling for attacks on the United States military constitutes terrorism and a radical ideology that must be condemned;  Whereas, at the People’s Conference for Palestine, Hani Al-Masri characterized the October 7th Hamas terrorist attacks not as terrorism, but as a natural reaction and part of a long historical arc;
                 

 Whereas Hani Al-Masri stated, In this context, October 7 came to complete what they had not accomplished in 1948 and 1967… it was a natural reaction to protect the people and the cause;
         

 Whereas Hani Al-Masri further stated, October 7 reminded me of the Paris Commune, the revolution that erupted and was the beginning of the European revolution and the change of Europe and the world. It is true that the Commune did not succeed, but it was the beginning of change in the whole world;
         

 Whereas, at the People’s Conference for Palestine, speaker Nidal Jboor called for the assassination of politicians in the United States, Israel, and Europe who oppose a Palestinian state;
                 

 Whereas Nidal Jboor stated, We know who they are—whether in Israel, Tel Aviv, Washington, or Europe. They must be locked up, taken out, neutralized to save children and humanity;
         
Whereas Omar Assaf, a terrorist affiliated with the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, was given a platform to speak at the People’s Conference for Palestine; Whereas the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine is designated as a terrorist organization by some countries and has a decades-long record of violence—including alleged participation in the October 7 attacks; 

 Whereas, at the People’s Conference for Palestine, a panel purportedly focused on health care highlighted Abu Nidal, who led the Abu Nidal Organization (ANO), a splinter group from Fatah and one of the most violent Palestinian terrorist outfits in history;
                 

 Whereas Thaer Ahmed stated, All of our names have really profound meanings and a deep connection to Palestine… look up what Nidal means later;
         
Whereas Abu Nidal ordered attacks in 20 countries, was responsible for over 300 deaths and 650 injuries, and orchestrated the 1985 Rome and Vienna airport massacres, during which gunmen opened fire at El Al ticket counters, killing 20 people;  Whereas, at the People’s Conference for Palestine, Sachin Peddada—Research Coordinator at the Progressive International and a Ph.D. student in Economics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst—called the United States evil and urged attendees to destroy the idea of America;
                 

 Whereas Sachin Peddada stated, …the thing to do is to destroy the idea of America in Americans’ heads so that they can see the humanity of everybody outside the warping of American exceptionalism and imperialism;
         

 Whereas, at the People’s Conference for Palestine, Omar Suleiman—founder of the Yaqeen Institute, imam at Valley Ranch Islamic Center, and adjunct professor at Southern Methodist University—praised the Holy Land Foundation Five, men convicted in the U.S. of funneling millions of dollars to Hamas under the cover of charity;
                 

 Whereas the Holy Land Foundation trial was the largest terrorism financing case in United States history, with evidence showing that money was knowingly routed to Hamas;
                 

 Whereas, at the People’s Conference for Palestine, Houston-based PYM organizer Mohammed Nabulsi called for targeting embassies;
                 

 Whereas Mohammed Nabulsi stated, It’s empowering when we channel our campaigns into tangible, strategic targets that have to respond to us… An Egyptian gentleman in The Hague went up to the Egyptian embassy and wrapped a little lock around the gates—and it exposed the complicity of the Egyptian state. Did you see how the Egyptian state responded? Did you see how it inspired everyone else to act?;
                 

 Whereas, at the People’s Conference for Palestine, Dalal Al-Mughrabi—a terrorist who hijacked a bus and killed 38 civilians, 13 of them children—was labeled a hero;
                 

 Whereas Representative Rashida Tlaib attacked both Republicans and Democrats for supporting America’s ally, Israel, labeling them sellouts and calling for unrest and violence in our streets;
         

 Whereas Representative Rashida Tlaib stated, Change doesn’t come from the cowards and warmongers in Congress. It comes from the streets. It comes from all of us mobilizing and seizing the power to resist and fight back;
         

 Whereas Representative Rashida Tlaib is vilifying fellow politicians—blasting supposed allies as sellouts, framing any support for Israel as soul-corrupting, and urging the crowd to stay militantly loyal to the most uncompromising line;
         

 Whereas Representative Rashida Tlaib has a history of promoting false, antisemitic narratives regarding the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel and has called for the destruction of the State of Israel;
                 

 Whereas, on November 3, 2023, Representative Rashida Tlaib published on social media a video containing the phrase from the river to the sea, which is widely recognized as a genocidal call to violence to destroy the State of Israel and its people;
                 
Whereas supporters of terrorism have no place in the United States Congress;  Whereas Representative Rashida Tlaib has repeatedly displayed conduct entirely unbecoming of a Member of the House of Representatives by calling for the destruction of the State of Israel and by dangerously promoting terrorism and extremism while Israeli and American hostages remain in terrorist captivity: Now, therefore, be it
                 
 
That Representative Rashida Tlaib be censured.
