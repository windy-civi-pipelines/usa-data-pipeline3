Whereas, on October 7, 2023, Hamas violated an existing cease-fire, and with Palestinian Islamic Jihad, other terrorist groups, and Gaza civilians infiltrated Israel, invaded Israeli towns, launched thousands of rockets into Israel, brutally murdered, raped, and burned alive more than 1,200 individuals, took 251 hostages, including Americans and citizens of more than 40 countries, and destroyed and looted entire communities; Whereas, on October 7, Hamas committed brutal acts of sexual violence, including gang rape and sexual mutilation, and the United Nation’s Special Representative of the Secretary General on Sexual Violence in Conflict and her team found clear and convincing information that sexual violence, including rape, sexualized torture, cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment has been committed against hostages; 
Whereas a senior Hamas official openly promised a second, third, fourth October 7-style attack against Israel; Whereas, even today, Hamas continues to fire rockets, including from within designated humanitarian zones, into Israel and uses civilians as human shields; 
Whereas Israel, like other sovereign states, has a right to defend herself from terrorist organizations and others who seek its destruction and annihilation, such as Iranian-backed proxies, including Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and militias in Iraq; Whereas, since October 7, Iranian proxy groups have fired thousands of rockets, mortars, antitank missiles, and explosive unmanned aerial vehicles into Israel, and have attacked American and other allied servicemembers, bases, and ships in the middle east region;

Whereas the United States Government and regional partners have worked to end hostilities in the region and return all the hostages; Whereas 105 hostages were released in a negotiated hostage deal in November 2023, following mediation efforts led by the United States;

Whereas the United States and regional partners have provided humanitarian aid to civilians through various mechanisms to keep assistance out of the hands of Hamas; Whereas, in the aftermath of Hamas October 7 terrorist attacks, there has been a worldwide surge in antisemitism, impacting Jewish communities globally, including rising physical assaults, vandalism, and harassment targeting Jews; 
Whereas, on November 7, 2024, hundreds of Jewish soccer supporters were attacked in Amsterdam by masked mobs in a coordinated attack; Whereas, on May 21, 2025, 2 individuals who worked at the Israeli Embassy, American Sarah Milgrim and German-Israeli Yaron Lischinsky, were shot and killed outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, DC, by alleged attacker Elias Rodriguez, who witnesses noted after the shooting held up a keffiyeh and said, I did this for Gaza, free Palestine and further as the suspect was taken into custody, shouted free, free Palestine; 
Whereas, on June 1, 2025, alleged attacker Mohamed Sabry Soliman threw 2 lit Molotov cocktails at individuals participating in a peaceful gathering in Boulder, Colorado, calling attention to the hostages held in Gaza; and Whereas the attack resulted in 15 individuals being injured, and the death of Karen Diamond, who died of severe injuries that she suffered in the attack: Now, therefore, be it
