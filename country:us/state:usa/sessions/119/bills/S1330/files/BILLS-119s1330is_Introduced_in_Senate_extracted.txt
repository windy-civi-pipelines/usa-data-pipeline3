Section 1:
1.Short title; table of contents(a)Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Bolstering Research And Innovation Now Act or the BRAIN Act. (b)Table of contentsThe table of contents of this Act is as follows:Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents.Sec. 2. Findings; purposes.Sec. 3. Fostering transparency of biospecimen collections for brain cancer research.Sec. 4. Glioblastoma Therapeutics Network; brain tumor related cellular immunotherapy.Sec. 5.

Section 2:
2.Findings; purposes(a)FindingsCongress finds as follows:(1)According to the National Brain Tumor Society, based on data analyzed in 2024, more than 1,000,000 people in the United States are living with a brain tumor and approximately 94,000 were estimated to be diagnosed with a primary brain tumor in 2023.(2)Brain tumors do not discriminate and can affect people of all races, genders, and ages. Tragically, pediatric brain tumors are the leading cause of cancer-related death among children and young adults ages 19 and younger.(3)For malignant brain tumors, incidence and survival rates have remained stagnant for 45 years, with an average 5-year relative survival rate of 35.7 percent and only 6.9 percent for glioblastoma, the most common primary malignant brain tumor.(4)Most primary brain tumors are non-malignant, but many still require surgery and radiation. The results of available treatment options can vary from a successful return to normal life to possible disability or a life-threatening condition.(5)Despite the statistics described in paragraphs (1) through (4), there have been very few treatments ever approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat brain tumors, thereby resulting in little change in mortality rates for individuals with brain tumors.(6)As of the date of enactment of this Act, there is no prevention and no early detection protocol for brain tumors.(7)All people in the United States have a stake in reducing and eliminating brain tumors.(8)Patients living with a brain tumor and their families want cures. Short of cures, they want safe and effective ways to increase survival rates for such patients and improve the quality of life for such patients. (b)PurposesThe purposes of this Act are to—(1)strengthen research and treatment development regarding brain tumors; and(2)improve the adequacy and awareness of and access to specialized brain tumor and rare and recalcitrant cancer health care.
