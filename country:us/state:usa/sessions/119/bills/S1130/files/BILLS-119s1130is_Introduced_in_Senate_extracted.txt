and(xiv)mining practices that reduce environmental impact, including mining practices that reduce water usage, mitigate surface disturbance, and promote overall resource efficiency.(d)Mining Professional Development Advisory Board(1)In generalThere is established an advisory board, to be known as the Mining Professional Development Advisory Board. (2)CompositionThe Board shall be composed of 6 members, to be appointed by the Secretary not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, of whom—(A)3 shall be individuals who are actively working in the mining profession and for the mining industry; and (B)3 shall have experience in academia implementing and operating professional skills training and education programs in the mining sector.(3)DutiesThe Board shall—(A)evaluate grant applications received under subsection (c) and make recommendations to the Secretary for selection of grant recipients under that subsection;(B)propose the amount of the grant for each applicant recommended to be selected under subparagraph (A); and(C)perform oversight to ensure that grant funds awarded under subsection (c) are used for the purposes described in paragraph (4) of that subsection.(4)TermA member of the Board shall serve for a term of 4 years.(5)VacanciesA vacancy on the Board—(A)shall not affect the powers of the Board; and(B)shall be filled in the same manner as the original appointment was made by not later than 180 days after the date on which the vacancy occurs.(e)Authorization of appropriationsThere is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section $10,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2026 through 2033.
