Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the United States-Israel PTSD Collaborative Research Act.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress makes the following findings: 
(1)The Department of Veterans Affairs reports that about 29 percent of veterans who served in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom have had post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at some point in their life. In addition, that figure amounts to about 21 percent of Gulf War veterans and up to 10 percent of Vietnam veterans. (2)The Department of Veterans Affairs reports that among women veterans of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, almost 20 percent have been diagnosed with PTSD. 
(3)In the United States, it is thought that 70 percent of Americans have experienced at least one traumatic event in their lifetime, and approximately 20 percent of those persons have struggled or continue to struggle with symptoms of PTSD. (4)Studies show that PTSD has links to homelessness and substance abuse in the United States. The Department of Veterans Affairs estimates that approximately 11 percent of the homeless population are veterans and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration estimates that about 7 percent of veterans have a substance abuse disorder. 
(5)Our ally Israel, under constant attack from terrorist groups, experiences similar issues with Israeli veterans facing PTSD symptoms. Tel Aviv University’s National Center for Traumatic Stress and Resilience found that 12 percent of soldiers who served in the Gaza war experience severe PTSD. (6)Current treatment options in the United States focus on cognitive therapy, exposure therapy, or eye movement desensitization and reprocessing, but the United States must continue to look for more effective treatments. Several leading Israeli hospitals, academic institutions, and nonprofits dedicate research and services to treating PTSD.
