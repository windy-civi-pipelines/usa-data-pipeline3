The Government retains the right and responsibility to audit and enforce compliance with permitting requirements. Focusing upon permittees who are violating the law or standards rather than gatekeeping will make permitting more efficient while allowing an agency to protect the compelling interests for which permitting systems are intended.</text></paragraph></section><section id="H770FABBA4C854CADB36C72EC94B294C6"><enum>3.</enum><header>Permitting by rule</header><subsection
