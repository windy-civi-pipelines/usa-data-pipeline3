Section 1:
1.Short title
 This Act may be cited as the Preventing the Abuse of Immigration Parole Act.

Section 2:
2.FindingsCongress finds the following: (1)The use of parole under immigration law, under the discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security, is intended and should only be granted on a case-by-case basis, strictly evaluating each individual applicant’s urgent humanitarian need or his or her significant public benefit. 
(2)Under the Biden Administration, Secretary Mayorkas abused this program, paroling an estimated total of 2.8 million aliens into the United States, bypassing lawful visa and refugee processes. (3)In its 2021 ruling in Texas v. Biden, the United States Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals wrote that Secretary Mayorkas’ parole of inadmissible aliens en masse is the opposite of case-by-case decision making and these actions led to misenforcement, suspension of the Immigration Nationality Act, or both. 
(4)The systemic abuse of parole for aliens outside the United States is a threat to national security and future abuse should be prevented.
