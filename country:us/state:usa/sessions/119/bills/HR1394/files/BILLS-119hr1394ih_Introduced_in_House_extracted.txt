(ii)processing techniques involving coagulation of the protein of milk or products obtained from milk to produce an end-product with similar physical, chemical, and or­gan­o­lep­tic characteristics as the product described in subclause (i); and (iii)including the addition of safe and suitable non-milk derived ingredients of the type permitted in the standards of identity described in clause (B) as natural cheese; or
