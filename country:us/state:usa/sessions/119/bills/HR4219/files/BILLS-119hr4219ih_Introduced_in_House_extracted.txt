(d)DefinitionsIn this section: (1)Invasive speciesThe term invasive species means, with regard to a particular ecosystem, a non-native organism whose introduction causes or is likely to cause economic or environmental harm or harm to human, animal, or plant health. 
(2)Early detectionThe term early detection means a process of surveying for, reporting, and verifying the presence of a non-native species before the founding population becomes established or spreads so widely that eradication is no longer feasible. (3)Priority invasive speciesThe term priority invasive species means an invasive species that is a major concern and necessary to map, monitor, and manage based on the following factors: 
(A)Potential impact on other native species. (B)Ability to alter habitats. 
(C)Ability to harm human health. (D)Severity of economic impact. 
(4)ProgramThe term Program means the National Wildlife Refuge System Invasive Species Strike Team Program authorized under subsection (b)(1). (5)SecretaryThe term Secretary means the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.
