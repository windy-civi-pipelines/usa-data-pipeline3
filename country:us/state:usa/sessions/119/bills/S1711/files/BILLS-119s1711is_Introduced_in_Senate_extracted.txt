Section 1:
1.
            Short title
 This Act may be cited as the Safeguarding Transit Operations to Prohibit China Act or the STOP China Act.

Section 2:
2.
            Sense of Congress
 It is the sense of Congress that—  (1) the People’s Republic of China (referred to in this section as the PRC) uses a deliberately intricate web of industrial policies to distort market behavior to achieve dominance in global markets and increase the dependence of the United States on imports from the PRC;
            
            
                (2)
 the adoption of PRC-developed technologies in the United States, including those used in certain vehicles, poses a significant risk to national security and threatens the long-term competitiveness of the United States;
            
            
                (3)
 the PRC intentionally creates overcapacity and sells products at below-market prices to gain market share and undermine United States domestic supply chains;
            
            
                (4)
 Congress must continue to confront the military-civil fusion strategy of the PRC and the intrusion of the PRC into the United States transportation market, as Congress has done in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (Public Law 116–92; 133 Stat. 1198) and the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024 (Public Law 118–63; 138 Stat. 1025);
            
            
                (5)
 United States taxpayer dollars should not be used to fund PRC-subsidized vehicle manufacturing or technology companies; and
            
            
                (6)
 any entity accepting Federal funding must be prevented from procuring certain vehicles—
                
                    (A)
 from a PRC entity or an entity otherwise related legally or financially to a corporation based in the PRC; or
                
                
                    (B)
 that contain certain vehicle technologies identified as matters of national security concern.

        II
        119th CONGRESS
        1st Session
        S. 1711
        IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
        
            May 12, 2025
            Mr. Cornyn (for himself, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Scott of
                    Florida, Mr. Peters,
                    Ms. Smith, Mr.
                    Ricketts, Mrs. Capito, and
                    Mrs. Blackburn) introduced the following
                bill; which was read twice and referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs
        
        A BILL
        To address national security risks and prohibit the use of Federal funds for
            the procurement of certain vehicles and vehicle technologies produced or provided by
            entities based in certain countries, and for other purposes.
    
    
        
            1.
            Short title
 This Act may be cited as the Safeguarding Transit Operations to Prohibit China Act or the STOP China Act.
        
        
            2.
            Sense of Congress
 It is the sense of Congress that—  (1) the People’s Republic of China (referred to in this section as the PRC) uses a deliberately intricate web of industrial policies to distort market behavior to achieve dominance in global markets and increase the dependence of the United States on imports from the PRC;
            
            
                (2)
 the adoption of PRC-developed technologies in the United States, including those used in certain vehicles, poses a significant risk to national security and threatens the long-term competitiveness of the United States;
            
            
                (3)
 the PRC intentionally creates overcapacity and sells products at below-market prices to gain market share and undermine United States domestic supply chains;
            
            
                (4)
 Congress must continue to confront the military-civil fusion strategy of the PRC and the intrusion of the PRC into the United States transportation market, as Congress has done in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (Public Law 116–92; 133 Stat. 1198) and the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024 (Public Law 118–63; 138 Stat. 1025);
            
            
                (5)
 United States taxpayer dollars should not be used to fund PRC-subsidized vehicle manufacturing or technology companies; and
            
            
                (6)
 any entity accepting Federal funding must be prevented from procuring certain vehicles—
                
                    (A)
 from a PRC entity or an entity otherwise related legally or financially to a corporation based in the PRC; or
                
                
                    (B)
 that contain certain vehicle technologies identified as matters of national security concern.
                
            
        
        
            3.
