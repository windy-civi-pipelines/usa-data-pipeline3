(3)the Authority is required to, among other things, provide decent, safe, and sanitary housing for the public housing residents of the City and comply with Federal law protecting children from the hazards of lead poisoning; (4)on June 11, 2018, the United States filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (in this section referred to as the Complaint); which set forth the findings of the United States investigation, alleging, among other things, that the Authority had—
