Section 1:
1.Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Rosa Parks Commemorative Coin Act.

Section 2:
2.FindingsThe Congress finds the following:(1)Rosa Parks, widely celebrated as the Mother of the Civil Rights Movement, became an iconic figure when she refused to give up her seat on a segregated bus in Montgomery, Alabama, on December 1, 1955, igniting a pivotal movement that challenged racial segregation and forever altered the course of American history.(2)Born on February 4, 1913, in Tuskegee, Alabama, to Leona McCauley, a teacher, and James McCauley, a carpenter, Parks grew up in the segregated South, experiencing firsthand the harsh realities of racial injustice.(3)Despite the profound challenges of racial inequality, Parks attended segregated schools in Alabama, graduating high school in 1933, where her education and experiences fueled her lifelong commitment to activism.(4)In 1943, Parks became deeply involved with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, where she served as Secretary and Youth Leader, investigating cases of racial violence such as the rape of Recy Taylor and the lynching of Emmett Till.(5)On December 1, 1955, Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat to a White man on a segregated bus in Montgomery, Alabama, an act that led to the historic 381-day Montgomery Bus Boycott by more than 40,000 riders.(6)The boycott sparked a legal challenge to Montgomery’s bus segregation laws, which culminated in the Supreme Court’s landmark decision in Browder v. Gayle declaring bus segregation unconstitutional on November 13, 1956.(7)Following the boycott, Parks faced significant personal and economic hardships, including the loss of her job and ongoing threats to her life, yet her determination to fight for justice remained steadfast.(8)In 1957, Parks moved to Detroit, Michigan, where she continued her work as an advocate for racial equality, focusing on economic justice, political participation, and racial integration.(9)Parks became a global symbol of resistance to racial segregation and injustice, and her act of defiance inspired civil rights movements around the world.(10)Throughout her life, Parks remained committed to civil rights activism, participating in marches and speaking engagements, as well as mentoring younger generations of activists, furthering her legacy of leadership in the struggle for racial equality.(11)Parks passed away on October 24, 2005, at the age of 92, leaving an enduring legacy of courage, resilience, and leadership that continues to inspire social justice and equality advocates across the globe.(12)In recognition of her profound impact, Parks became the first woman and second African American to lie in honor in the United States Capitol Rotunda.(13)In 1996, President Bill Clinton awarded Parks the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor bestowed by the President of the United States.(14)In 1999, Parks received the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest expression of national appreciation for distinguished achievements and contributions bestowed by the United States Congress.(15)Parks’ legacy is commemorated through numerous schools, streets, transit stations, and monuments named in her honor, ensuring that her contributions to American history are remembered and celebrated.(16)In 2006, Ohio became the first state to designate December 1, the day of Parks’ arrest, as Rosa Parks Day, garnering unanimous support from the state legislature and being signed into law by Governor Bob Taft.(17)Rosa Parks Day is also celebrated in the states of California, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, and New York on her birthday, February 4, and in Alabama, Oregon, Tennessee, and Texas on December 1.(18)It is fitting and proper to recognize and preserve the achievements and impact of Rosa Parks, whose personal sacrifice, unwavering resistance, and inspirational advocacy were essential to the success of the Civil Rights Movement, and whose legacy continues to serve as a beacon of hope and inspiration for future generations.
