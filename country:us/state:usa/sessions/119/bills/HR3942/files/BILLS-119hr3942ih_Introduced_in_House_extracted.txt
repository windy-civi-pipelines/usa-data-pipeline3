(3)Applicable hospital definedFor purposes of this subsection, the term applicable hospital means any hospital located in a State that meets either of the following criteria: (A)The hospital provides labor and delivery services and more than 50 percent of the hospital’s births (in the most recent year for which such data is available) are financed by the Medicaid program or CHIP.
