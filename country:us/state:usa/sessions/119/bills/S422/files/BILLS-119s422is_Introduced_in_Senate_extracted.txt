Section 3:
3.FindingsCongress finds the following:(1)The right to contraception is a fundamental right, central to an individual’s privacy, health, well-being, dignity, liberty, equality, and ability to participate in the social and economic life of the Nation.(2)The Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized the constitutional right to contraception.(3)In Griswold v. Connecticut (381 U.S. 479 (1965)), the Supreme Court first recognized the constitutional right for married people to use contraceptives.(4)In Eisenstadt v. Baird (405 U.S. 438 (1972)), the Supreme Court confirmed the constitutional right of all people to legally access contraceptives regardless of marital status.(5)In Carey v. Population Services International (431 U.S. 678 (1977)), the Supreme Court affirmed the constitutional right to contraceptives for minors.(6)The right to contraception has been repeatedly recognized internationally as a human right. The United Nations Population Fund has published several reports outlining family planning as a basic human right that advances women’s health, economic empowerment, and equality.(7)Access to contraceptives is internationally recognized by the World Health Organization as advancing other human rights such as the right to life, liberty, expression, health, work, and education.(8)Contraception is safe, essential health care, and access to contraceptive products and services is central to people’s ability to participate equally in economic and social life in the United States and globally. Contraception allows people to make decisions about their families and their lives.(9)Contraception is key to sexual and reproductive health. Contraception is critical to preventing unintended pregnancy, and many contraceptives are highly effective in preventing and treating a wide array of medical conditions and decrease the risk of certain cancers.(10)Contraception has been associated with improved health outcomes for women, their families, and their communities and reduces rates of maternal and infant mortality and morbidity.(11)The United States has a long history of reproductive coercion, including the childbearing forced upon enslaved women, as well as the forced sterilization of Black women, Puerto Rican women, indigenous women, immigrant women, and disabled women, and reproductive coercion continues to occur. This history also includes the coercive testing of contraceptive pills on women and girls in Puerto Rico.(12)The right to make personal decisions about contraceptive use is important for all Americans, and is especially critical for historically marginalized groups, including—(A)Black, indigenous, and other people of color;(B)immigrants; (C)LGBTQ+ people; (D)people with disabilities;(E)people paid low wages; and (F)people living in rural and underserved areas. (13)Many people who are part of the marginalized groups described in paragraph (12) already face barriers, exacerbated by social, political, economic, and environmental inequities, to comprehensive health care, including reproductive health care, that reduce their ability to make decisions about their health, families, and lives.(14)State and Federal policies governing pharmaceutical and insurance policies affect the accessibility of contraceptives and the settings in which contraception services are delivered.(15)People engage in interstate commerce to access contraception services.(16)To provide contraception services, health care providers employ and obtain commercial services from doctors, nurses, and other personnel who engage in interstate commerce and travel across State lines.(17)Congress has the authority to enact this Act to protect access to contraception pursuant to—(A)its powers under the Commerce Clause of section 8 of article I of the Constitution of the United States;(B)its powers under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States to enforce the provisions of section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment; and(C)its powers under the necessary and proper clause of section 8 of article I of the Constitution of the United States.(18)Congress has used its authority in the past to protect and expand access to contraception information, products, and services.(19)In 1970, Congress established the family planning program under title X of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300 et seq.), the only Federal grant program dedicated to family planning and related services, providing access to information, products, and services for contraception.(20)In 1972, Congress required the Medicaid program to cover family planning services and supplies and the Medicaid program currently accounts for 75 percent of Federal funds spent on family planning.(21)In 2010, Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111–148) (referred to in this section as the ACA). Among other provisions, the ACA included provisions to expand the affordability and accessibility of contraception by requiring health insurance plans to provide coverage for preventive services with no patient cost-sharing.(22)States have tried to ban access to some or all contraceptives by restricting access to public funding for these products and services. Furthermore, Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri, and Texas have infringed on people’s ability to access their contraceptive care by violating the free choice of provider requirement under the Medicaid program. (23)Providers’ refusals to offer contraceptives and information related to contraception based on their own personal beliefs impede patients from obtaining their preferred method of contraception, with laws in 12 States as of the date of introduction of this Act specifically allowing health care providers to refuse to provide services related to contraception.(24)States have attempted to define abortion expansively so as to include contraceptives in State bans on abortion and have also restricted access to emergency contraception.(25)Justice Thomas, in his concurring opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization (142 S. Ct. 2228 (2022)), stated that the Supreme Court should reconsider all of this Court’s substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell and that the Court has a duty to correct the error established in those precedents by overruling them. (26)In order to further public health and to combat efforts to restrict access to reproductive health care, congressional action is necessary to protect access to contraceptives, contraception, and information related to contraception for everyone, regardless of actual or perceived race, ethnicity, sex (including gender identity and sexual orientation), income, disability, national origin, immigration status, or geography.

Section 4:
4.PurposesThe purposes of this Act are—(1)to provide a clear and comprehensive right to contraception;(2)to permit individuals to seek and obtain contraceptives and engage in contraception, and to permit health care providers to facilitate that care; and(3)to protect an individual’s ability to make decisions about their body, medical care, family, and life’s course, and thereby protect the individual’s ability to participate equally in the economic and social life of the United States.

Section 5:
5.Permitted services(a)In generalAn individual has a statutory right under this Act to obtain contraceptives and to voluntarily engage in contraception, free from coercion, and a health care provider has a corresponding right to provide contraceptives, contraception, and information, referrals, and services related to contraception.(b)Limitations or requirementsThe statutory rights specified in subsection (a) shall not be limited or otherwise infringed through any limitation or requirement that—(1)expressly, effectively, implicitly, or as-implemented singles out—(A)the provision of contraceptives, contraception, or contraception-related information;(B)health care providers who provide contraceptives, contraception, or contraception-related information; or(C)facilities in which contraceptives, contraception, or contraception-related information is provided; and(2)impedes access to contraceptives, contraception, or contraception-related information.(c)ExceptionTo defend against a claim that a limitation or requirement violates a health care provider’s or individual’s statutory rights under subsection (b), a party must establish, by clear and convincing evidence, that—(1)the limitation or requirement significantly advances access to contraceptives, contraception, and information related to contraception; and(2)access to contraceptives, contraception, and information related to contraception or the health of patients cannot be advanced by a less restrictive alternative measure or action.(d)Rule of constructionNothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, to approve, clear, authorize, or license contraceptives under section 505, 510(k), 513(f)(2), 515, or 564 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355, 360(k), 360c(f)(2), 360e, 360bbb–3) or section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262), or for the Federal Government to enforce such approval, clearance, authorization, or licensure.

Section 6:
6.Applicability and preemption(a)General application(1)In generalExcept as provided in subsection (c), this Act supersedes and applies to the law of the Federal Government and each State, and the implementation of such law, whether statutory, common law, or otherwise, and whether adopted before or after the date of enactment of this Act.(2)ProhibitionNeither the Federal Government nor any State may administer, implement, or enforce any law, rule, regulation, standard, or other provision having the force and effect of law in a manner that—(A)prohibits or restricts the sale, provision, or use of any contraceptives;(B)prohibits or restricts any individual from aiding another individual in voluntarily obtaining or using any contraceptives or contraceptive methods; or(C)exempts any contraceptives or contraceptive methods from any other generally applicable law in a way that would make it more difficult to sell, provide, obtain, or use such contraceptives or contraceptive methods.(3)Relationship with other lawsThis Act applies notwithstanding any other provision of Federal law, including the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. 2000bb et seq.).(b)Subsequently enacted Federal legislationFederal law enacted after the date of enactment of this Act is subject to this Act, unless such law explicitly excludes such application by reference to this Act.(c)LimitationsThe provisions of this Act shall not supersede or otherwise affect any provision of Federal law relating to coverage under (and shall not be construed as requiring the provision of specific benefits under) group health plans or group or individual health insurance coverage or coverage under a Federal health care program (as defined in section 1128B(f) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320a–7b(f))), including coverage provided under section 1905(a)(4)(C) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396d(a)(4)(C)) and section 2713 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300gg–13).(d)DefenseIn any cause of action against an individual or entity who is subject to a limitation or requirement that violates this Act, in addition to the remedies specified in section 8, this Act shall also apply to, and may be raised as a defense by, such an individual or entity.(e)Effective dateThis Act shall take effect immediately upon the date of enactment of this Act.
