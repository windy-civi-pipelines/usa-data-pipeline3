IV119th CONGRESS1st SessionH. RES. 224IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESMarch 14, 2025Mrs. Miller of Illinois (for herself, Mr. Harris of Maryland, Mr. LaMalfa, Mr. Ogles, Mr. Babin, Mr. Rose, and Mr. Crenshaw) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committee on the Judiciary, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concernedRESOLUTIONExpressing support for the recognition of Detransition Awareness Day. 
Whereas many individuals who have undergone sex trait modification interventions later regret such interventions; Whereas the number of individuals seeking to reverse such interventions has risen significantly, highlighting a need for greater understanding and support; 
Whereas many individuals who have undergone sex trait modification interventions face irreversible physical changes and suffer from a range of health complications, including genital mutilation, sexual dysfunction, infertility, osteoporosis, and psychological distress; Whereas there is a critical need for comprehensive, noninvasive, and evidence-based care for individuals experiencing discomfort with their sex that focuses on mental health support rather than solely on physiological interventions; and 
Whereas individuals who have undergone sex trait modification interventions and have returned to living in the reality of their sex often encounter retribution and hateful rhetoric for publicly announcing regret and face barriers to receiving appropriate medical, psychological, and social support after making the choice to detransition, including lack of insurance coverage for corrective or reparative treatments: Now, therefore, be it   That the House of Representatives— 
(1)supports the recognition of Detransition Awareness Day to acknowledge the experiences of individuals who have detransitioned, or are in the process of detransitioning, and have returned to living in the reality of their sex, and to foster public and legislative understanding of the challenges of such individuals; (2)urges the development and implementation of policies that— 
(A)ensure comprehensive mental health services are available for individuals who experience discomfort with their sex; and (B)advocate for informed consent processes that fully disclose the risks of sex trait modification interventions, including the potential for regret and the irreversible nature of such interventions; 
(3)calls for legislative action to— (A)extend the statute of limitations for claims related to medical malpractice or negligence in providing sex trait modification interventions to recognize the delayed realization of harm in many cases; and 
(B)remove any existing caps on damages for individuals harmed by sex trait modification interventions to ensure adequate compensation for both physical and psychological injuries; (4)requests that the Department of Health and Human Services conduct a review of current literature regarding care for individuals struggling with discomfort due to their sex, promulgate new guidelines, as determined necessary, to promote ethical medical standards and practices that do not involve physiologically invasive practices that attempt to alter the sex traits of an individual, and revise guidelines to better protect patient rights and health; 
(5)commends individuals who have detransitioned, or are in the process of detransitioning, and have returned to living in the reality of their sex for their courage in sharing their stories and working towards better care and understanding for those in similar situations; and (6)encourages all States to adopt similar resolutions and initiatives to support such individuals and to ensure that all medical interventions are conducted according to the highest ethical standards.
