            Microplastics in land-applied biosolids on farmland
 Section 1672(d) of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 (7 U.S.C. 5925(d)) is amended by adding at the end the following:

                    Microplastics in land-applied biosolids on farmland
 Research and extension grants may be made under this section for the purposes of carrying out or enhancing research on the agricultural impacts of plastic or plastic-coated particles that are less than 5 millimeters in any dimension (referred to in this paragraph as microplastics) in land-applied biosolids on farmland, including—
                    
                        (A)
 by conducting surveys and collecting data on microplastic concentration, particle size, and chemical composition in land-applied biosolids on farmland; 
                    
                    
                        (B)
 through the development or analysis of wastewater treatment techniques to filter out or biodegrade microplastics from biosolids intended to be used for agricultural purposes;
                    
                    
                        (C)
 by conducting an analysis of the impact on agricultural crops and soil health of microplastics in land-applied biosolids on farmland; 
                    
                    
                        (D)
 by conducting research to better understand how wastewater processing impacts microplastics; and
                    
                    
                        (E)
 by conducting research to better understand the fate, residence time, and transport of microplastics on farmland.
                    
                
                .

Section 3:
3.
            Reauthorization of high-priority research and extension initiatives
 Section 1672 of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 (7 U.S.C. 5925) is amended by striking 2023 each place it appears in subsection (e)(5), subsection (f)(5), paragraphs (1)(B), (2)(B), and (3) of subsection (g), and subsection (h) and inserting 2031.
