which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary, and in addition to the Committee on Armed Services, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concernedRESOLUTIONRecognizing the right to peacefully protest and condemning violence and authoritarian responses to expressions of dissent.Whereas U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents recently carried out immigration enforcement raids in Southern California;Whereas prioritizing the removal of individuals who pose a clear threat to public safety, such as those convicted of violent crimes, is essential to maintaining trust and justice in the immigration system;Whereas ICE has conducted raids by deploying unmarked Federal agents to detain individuals on the streets, at their homes, and at places of employment;Whereas many citizens objected to the ICE raids and peacefully protested ICE activity, primarily in an approximately 10-block area of downtown Los Angeles, California;Whereas the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States protects the right of the people peaceably to assemble;Whereas peaceful protest is a cornerstone of American democracy and an essential means for individuals to express dissent, demand change, and advocate for justice;Whereas troublemakers also infiltrated these peaceful demonstrations and committed unlawful acts of violence, vandalism, looting, and destruction of property;Whereas these unlawful acts harm small businesses;Whereas such acts of violence undermine the goals of peaceful protest and endanger the safety and security of all community members;Whereas law enforcement and elected officials provided clear assurances that those who committed violent acts will be arrested and prosecuted;Whereas local and state law enforcement agencies successfully worked to protect the public, ensure the safety of peaceful demonstrators, and restore order in areas impacted by violence;Whereas the Chief of the Los Angeles Police Department assessed the situation was nowhere near a level where the Department would need assistance from the National Guard;Whereas public officials have a responsibility to lower the temperature and not enflame tensions;Whereas, on June 7, 2025, the President activated 2,000 members of the California National Guard to Los Angeles and subsequently authorized an additional 2,000 National Guard personnel to be placed on standby for potential Federal activation;Whereas the legal authority the Trump Administration cited for the activation, 10 U.S.C. § 12406, permits federalization of the National Guard only in specific and extraordinary circumstances—including invasion, rebellion, or the inability of regular forces to execute the law—none of which were present;Whereas 10 U.S.C. § 12406 also requires orders to activate the National Guard be issued through the governor of the affected state;Whereas the President activated the National Guard without any request from the Governor of California;Whereas the activation of the National Guard escalated and inflamed the situation;Whereas the President also deployed 700 active-duty Marines to the Los Angeles area, further escalating the situation;Whereas the Posse Comitatus Act prohibits the use of active-duty armed forces for domestic law enforcement except in limited circumstances, none of which the President invoked;Whereas the acting Comptroller of the Department of Defense, Bryn MacDonnell, testified to Congress that the deployment of National Guard members and Marines to Los Angeles is estimated to cost $134 million over the 60-day deployment; andWhereas deploying the National Guard and active-duty military personnel into a U.S. city without invoking the proper statutory authorities nor coordinating with state and local government officials is illegal, irresponsible, a disproportionate response which increases the likelihood of violence, exacerbates the situation, presents a logistical challenge to local law enforcement, and threatens the safety of the public and all law enforcement personnel: Now, therefore, be itThat the House of Representatives—(1)reaffirms its support for the First Amendment right to peacefully assemble and protest;(2)supports civil rights and civil liberties, including the right to due process, for all persons;(3)condemns instigators who have committed acts of violence against law enforcement, vandalism, looting, and destruction of property;(4)emphasizes that all law enforcement, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement, has a duty to conduct their operations with transparency and accountability to the public;(5)denounces the inflammatory language of the Trump Administration that has worsened tensions within U.S. communities;(6)reiterates support for the military servicemembers in the Marines and National Guard while objecting to their current California deployment; and(7)commends the law enforcement officers who worked to protect public safety, enabled peaceful protests, and upheld the rule of law during these challenging times.
